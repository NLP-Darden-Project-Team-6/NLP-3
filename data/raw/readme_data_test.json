At the minimum, you need a container, an unordered list of links for your tabs, and matching divs for your tabbed content.\n<div id=\"tab-container\">\n  <ul>\n    <li><a href=\"#tab-1-div\">Tab 1<\/a><\/li>\n    <li><a href=\"#that-other-tab\">The Second Tab<\/a><\/li>\n    <li><a href=\"#lastly\">Tab C<\/a><\/li>\n  <\/ul>\n  <div id=\"tab-1-div\">\n    <h2>Heading 1<\/h2>\n    <p>This is the content of the first tab.<\/p>\n  <\/div>\n    <div id=\"that-other-tab\">\n    <h2>Heading 2<\/h2>\n    <p>Stuff from the second tab.<\/p>\n  <\/div>\n  <div id=\"lastly\">\n    <h2>Heading 3<\/h2>\n    <p>More stuff from the last tab.<\/p>\n  <\/div>\n<\/div>\n\nThe Javascript\nTo enable back- and forward-button support for the users' browsers, be sure to include either the jQuery HashChange plugin (recommended) or the Address plugin before including the EasyTabs plugin. There is no other configuration required, it will just work!\n<script src=\"\/javascripts\/jquery.js\" type=\"text\/javascript\"><\/script> \n<script src=\"\/javascripts\/jquery.hashchange.js\" type=\"text\/javascript\"><\/script> \n<script src=\"\/javascripts\/jquery.easytabs.js\" type=\"text\/javascript\"><\/script>  \n\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\"> \n  $(document).ready(function(){ $('#tab-container').easytabs(); });\n<\/script> \n\nI varied the tab ids and names just to show you how flexible this is. There is no magic going on with this plugin; it's not trying to guess the order of your tabs or what tab is associated with which <div>. Just make the id of the content <div> match the href of the tab link.\nRequired Markup\nThe only rules you need to follow are these:\n\ncontaining <div> with a unique id\nthe container <div>\u00a0contains an unordered list <ul>\u00a0of links <a>\n\n(UPDATE: As of version 1.1, this is no longer the case. You can now include your tabs anywhere within the container. It can be a <ul>, <ol>, <div>, or anything you want. The default is still a top-level <ul>, so to change it you just specify your selector with the new \"tabs\" option.)\n\nthe container div also contains content divs (for the tabbed content), each div has a unique id\u00a0that matches the href property of a link in the unordered list\n\nOther than that, go nuts. The order of the elements does NOT matter. Your <ul> could be before or after the content divs (or even between them). You can put non-tabbed content between the elements. It doesn't matter. The most common structure (for inspiration's sake) is something like this:\ndiv#tab-container ul > ( li > a[href=\"tab-1\"], li > a[href=\"second-tab\"] )\ndiv#tab-container div#tab-1\ndiv#tab-container div#second-tab\n\n+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n|                              div#tab-container                            |\n|  +---------------------------------------------------------------------+  |\n|  |                                  ul                                 |  |\n|  |  +-----------------------------+    +----------------------------+  |  |\n|  |  |             li              |    |             li             |  |  |\n|  |  |  +-----------------------+  |    |  +----------------------+  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |    a[href=\"tab-1\"]    |  |    |  | a[href=\"second-tab\"] |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  +-----------------------+  |    |  +----------------------+  |  |  |\n|  |  +-----------------------------+    +----------------------------+  |  |\n|  +---------------------------------------------------------------------+  |\n|                                                                           |\n|  +---------------------------------------------------------------------+  |\n|  |                               div#tab-1                             |  |\n|  +---------------------------------------------------------------------+  |\n|                                                                           |\n|  +---------------------------------------------------------------------+  |\n|  |                             div#second-tab                          |  |\n|  +---------------------------------------------------------------------+  |\n|                                                                           |\n+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n\n\nFor stylization, configuration options, and live demos, see the EasyTabs homepage.\n\nLinks\n\nFull Documentation and Demos\nUpdates and new features for v1.1.2\nUpdates and new features for v2.0\nUpdates and new features for v2.1.2\nDownload jQuery EasyTabs\nFork and view source code\n\nInfo\n\nAuthor: Steve Schwartz\nCompany: Alfa Jango, LLC\nLicense: Dual licensed under the MIT and GPL licenses.\n\n","3":"\nVisit the Mimosa Website for all sorts of Mimosa documentation goodness.\nQuestions?\n\n\nGoogle Group\nTwitter @mimosajs\n\nQuick Start\nThere are a ton of docs on the site to get you started, but here's a quick start.\n\nInstall node.js.

This library has the following goals:\n\nPreserve the full capabilities of the fetch API\nProvide an extendable middleware API\nUse the same API on both client and server\n\nInstallation\nUsing npm:\n$ npm install --save http-client\n\nhttp-client requires you to bring your own global fetch function (for convenience when using the top-level createFetch function). isomorphic-fetch is a great polyfill if you need to support environments that don't already have a global fetch function.\nThen, use as you would anything else:\n\/\/ using ES6 modules\nimport { createFetch } from 'http-client'\n\n\/\/ using CommonJS modules\nvar createFetch = require('http-client').createFetch\nThe UMD build is also available on unpkg:\n<script src=\"https:\/\/unpkg.com\/http-client\/umd\/http-client.min.js\"><\/script>\nYou can find the library on window.HTTPClient.\nUsage\nhttp-client simplifies the process of creating flexible HTTP clients that work in both node and the browser. You create your own fetch function using the createFetch method, optionally passing middleware as arguments.\nimport { createFetch, base, accept, parse } from 'http-client'\n\nconst fetch = createFetch(\n  base('https:\/\/api.stripe.com\/v1'),  \/\/ Prefix all request URLs\n  accept('application\/json'),         \/\/ Set \"Accept: application\/json\" in the request headers\n  parse('json')                       \/\/ Read the response as JSON and put it in response.body\n)\n\nfetch('\/customers\/5').then(response => {\n  console.log(response.jsonData)\n})\nTop-level API\ncreateFetch(...middleware)\nCreates a fetch function that uses some middleware. Uses the global fetch function to actually make the request.\ncreateStack(...middleware)\nCombines several middleware into one, in the same order they are provided as arguments. Use this function to create re-usable middleware stacks or if you don't want to use a global fetch function.\nenableRecv(fetch)\nReturns an \"enhanced\" version of the given fetch function that knows how to run response handlers registered using recv. This is only really useful when using stacks directly instead of createFetch.\nMiddleware\nhttp-client provides a variety of middleware that may be used to extend the functionality of the client. Out of the box, http-client ships with the following middleware:\naccept(contentType)\nAdds an Accept header to the request.\nimport { createFetch, accept } from 'http-client'\n\nconst fetch = createFetch(\n  accept('application\/json')\n)\nauth(value)\nAdds an Authorization header to the request.\nimport { createFetch, auth } from 'http-client'\n\nconst fetch = createFetch(\n  auth('Bearer ' + oauth2Token)\n)\nbase(baseURL)\nAdds the given baseURL to the beginning of the request URL.\nimport { createFetch, base } from 'http-client'\n\nconst fetch = createFetch(\n  base('https:\/\/api.stripe.com\/v1')\n)\n\nfetch('\/customers\/5') \/\/ GET https:\/\/api.stripe.com\/v1\/customers\/5\nbody(content, contentType)\nSets the given content string as the request body.\nimport { createFetch, body } from 'http-client'\n\nconst fetch = createFetch(\n  body(JSON.stringify(data), 'application\/json')\n)\ndebug()\nAdds a debug property to the response or error object so you can inspect them. Mainly useful for testing\/debugging (should run after all other middleware).\nimport { createFetch, debug } from 'http-client'\n\nconst fetch = createFetch(\n  \/\/ ... other middleware\n  debug()\n)\n\nfetch(input).then(response => {\n  console.log(response.debug.input, response.debug.options)\n})\nheader(name, value)\nAdds a header to the request.\nimport { createFetch, header } from 'http-client'\n\nconst fetch = createFetch(\n  header('Content-Type', 'application\/json')\n)\ninit(propertyName, value)\nSets the value of an arbitrary property in the options object.\nimport { createFetch, init } from 'http-client'\n\nconst fetch = createFetch(\n  init('credentials', 'include')\n)\njson(object)\nAdds the data in the given object as JSON to the request body.\nmethod(verb)\nSets the request method.\nimport { createFetch, method } from 'http-client'\n\nconst fetch = createFetch(\n  method('POST')\n)\nparams(object)\nAdds the given object to the query string of GET\/HEAD requests and as a x-www-form-urlencoded payload on all others.\nimport { createFetch, method, params } from 'http-client'\n\n\/\/ Create a client that will append hello=world to the URL in the query string\nconst fetch = createFetch(\n  params({ hello: 'world' })\n)\n\n\/\/ Create a client that will send hello=world as POST data\nconst fetch = createFetch(\n  method('POST'),\n  params({ hello: 'world' })\n)\nparse(parser, as = 'body')\nReads the response body to completion, parses the response, and puts the result on response.body (or whatever as is). parser must be the name of a valid Body parsing method. The following parsers are available in the spec:\n\narrayBuffer\nblob\nformData\njson\ntext\n\nimport { createFetch, parse } from 'http-client'\n\nconst fetch = createFetch(\n  parse('json')\n)\n\nfetch(input).then(response => {\n  console.log(response.body)\n})\nNote: Some parsers may not be available when using a fetch polyfill. In particular if you're using node-fetch, you should be aware of its limitations.\nquery(object)\nAdds the data in the given object (or string) to the query string of the request URL.\nrecv(handler)\nUsed to handle the response in some way. The handler function should return the new response value, or a promise for it. Response handlers run in the order they are defined.\nimport { createFetch, recv } from 'http-client'\n\nconst fetch = createFetch(\n  recv(response => (console.log('runs first'), response)),\n  recv(response => (console.log('runs second'), response))\n)\nStacks\nMiddleware may be combined together into re-usable middleware \"stacks\" using createStack. A stack is itself a middleware that is composed of one or more other pieces of middleware. Thus, you can pass a stack directly to createFetch as if it were any other piece of middleware.\nThis is useful when you have a common set of functionality that you'd like to share between several different fetch methods, e.g.:\nimport { createFetch, createStack, header, base, parse, query } from 'http-client'\n\nconst commonStack = createStack(\n  header('X-Auth-Key', key),\n  header('X-Auth-Email', email),\n  base('https:\/\/api.cloudflare.com\/client\/v4'),\n  parse('json')\n)\n\n\/\/ This fetch function can be used standalone...\nconst fetch = createFetch(commonStack)\n\n\/\/ ...or we can add further middleware to create another fetch function!\nconst fetchSinceBeginningOf2015 = createFetch(\n  commonStack,\n  query({ since: '2015-01-01T00:00:00Z' })\n)\nStacks are also useful when you don't have a global fetch function, e.g. in node. In those cases, you can still use http-client middleware and supply your own fetch (we recommend node-fetch) function directly, but make sure you \"enhance\" it first:\nconst { createStack, enableRecv, header, base } = require('http-client')\n\n\/\/ We need to \"enhance\" node-fetch so it knows how to\n\/\/ handle responses correctly. Specifically, enableRecv\n\/\/ gives a fetch function the ability to run response\n\/\/ handlers registered with recv (which parse, used below,\n\/\/ uses behind the scenes).\nconst fetch = enableRecv(\n  require('node-fetch')\n)\n\nconst stack = createStack(\n  header('X-Auth-Key', key),\n  header('X-Auth-Email', email),\n  base('https:\/\/api.cloudflare.com\/client\/v4'),\n  parse('json')\n)\n\nstack(fetch, input, options)\n","8":"TouchScroll\nTouchScroll is a JavaScript\/CSS 3-based scrolling layer for Webkit Mobile, espeacially iPhone, Android, and iPad. It allows to configure scrolling behaviour in many ways and to use fixed interface elements.\nDependencies\nTouchScroll depends on css-beziers, a library for computations on cubic bezier curves.\nUsage\nTo use TouchScroll you need an element with fixed height.

I'm focused on making an automated workflow to create fun supercuts of \"The Wire\"...and will polish the scripts and implementation later. These notes and scripts (and data files) are merely for your reference.\ntl;dr\nIBM Watson offers a REST-based Speech to Text API that allows free usage for the first 1,000 minutes each month (and $0.02 for each additional minute):\n\nWatson Speech to Text can be used anywhere there is a need to bridge the gap between the spoken word and its written form. This easy-to-use service uses machine intelligence to combine information about grammar and language structure with knowledge of the composition of an audio signal to generate an accurate transcription. It uses IBM's speech recognition capabilities to convert speech in multiple languages into text. The transcription of incoming audio is continuously sent back to the client with minimal delay, and it is corrected as more speech is heard.\n\nIn my preliminary tests, it's not quite as good as Google Translate in terms of pure accuracy, but it's more than good enough for finding key words, whether they be relatively common verbs like \"fight\", \"death\", \"kill\" or proper nouns, such as Obama and countries of the world.\nBut it doesn't do too badly on very common (and aurally-ambiguous) short words such as pronouns and articles. Because Watson provides a confidence level for each word, it's possible to write scripts to programmatically filter out ambiguous words.\nHere's a YouTube playlist of some automated supercuts I've created from the U.S. presidential primary debates. My favorite is probably this supercut of Senator Sanders and Secretary Clinton saying fighting words.\n\nHere's the JSON returned from Watson, which includes word-by-word timestamps and confidence levels. Here's a simplified version of it, in which the JSON is just a flat list of words.\nIBM Watson's API is robust enough to accept many concurrent requests. In the sample scripts I've included in this repo, I was able to break up a 90 minute debate into 5 minute segments and send them up to Watson simultaneously...resulting in a 6 to 7 minute processing time for the entire 90 minutes.\nSome non-presidential examples:\n\nAttempting to transcribe the profanities in The Wire's \"Old Cases\" episode -- (youtube supercut, obviously nsfw)\nAttempting to transcribe a ProPublica podcast\n\nQuick *nix check!\nBefore you look at the scary Python framework I've built for myself, you should first if you can work with movie\/audio files and connect to Watson, using nothing but Unix tools: ffmpeg, and good ol' curl: check out this brief walkthrough\nSupercut fun\nYou probably want to see the final product. I'm too lazy to document all the code and haven't organized it yet, but here's one result: making supercuts by grepping the Watson Speech to Text data for certain words. For example, to find all \"fighting words\", e.g. war, wars, warriors, fight, bomb, kill, threat, terror, death, murder, torture:\n python supercut.py republican-debate-sc-2016-02-13 '\\bwar(?:riors?|s)?\\b|fight|bomb|kill|threat|terror|death|murder|tortur'\nHere's a playlist of sample supercuts of presidential people:\nRepublican Debate, South Carolina, 2016-02-13:\n\nPEOPLE\nAmerica, and other geopolitical words\nObama, Clinton, and Bush\nFighting words (fight, bomb, kill)\nNegative words (wrong, bad)\nPositive words (good, best)\n\nDemocratic Debate, Wisconsin, 2016-02-11:\n\nPEOPLE\nAmerica, and other geopolitical words\nObama, Clinton, and Bush\nFighting words (fight, bomb, kill)\nBut, Why, Not, Yes, Now\n\nObama weekly address\n\ncriminal, justice, reform\nwho, what, when, where, why, how (original video)\n\n\nThe technical details\nHow it works\nAfter you've downloaded a video file to disk, the assorted scripts and commands in this repo will:\n\nConvert the file to mp4 if necessary\nCreate a project subfolder to store the video file and all derived audio and transcripts file\nExtract the audio from as 16-bit, 16khz WAV files\nSplit the audio into segments (300 seconds each, by default)\nSend each of those segments to Watson's API to be analyzed and transcribed.\nSaves the raw responses from Watson's API for each audio file\nCompiles all of the resulting responses into one data file, as if you had sent the entire audio file to be analyzed in a single go.\n\nThe advantages of splitting up the audio is that it allows the transcription to be done in parallel. An hour-long audio track would take probably an hour to get a response back (if your internet connection doesn't fail), whereas 60 parallel requests to analyze 1-minute each will take roughly...1 minute to complete.\nI haven't tested the upper-bounds in concurrent requests to Watson's API, though I was able to send around 30 5-minute requests all at once without getting an errors.\nHere are some sample results in the projects\/ folder:\n\nThe Republican Presidential Debate, South Carolina, Feb. 13, 2016\nDonald Trump's \"Live Free or Die\" commercial\nPresident Obama's Weekly Video Address, Oct. 31, 2015\n\nRequirements\nIBM Watson\nThe transcription power comes from IBM Watson's Speech-to-Text REST API. After cutting up a video into 5-minute segments, I then upload all of the audio files in parallel to Watson, which can complete the entire batch in nearly just 5 minutes.\n\nLive Watson Speech-to-Text demo\nWatson's Speech-to-Text documentation\nAPI reference\n\nGetting started with IBM Bluemix\nYou have to sign up for an IBM Bluemix account, which is free and doesn't require a credit card for the first month.\nAfter signing up for Bluemix, you can find the console page for the speech-to-text API here, where you can get user credentials. This repo contains a sample file: credsfile_watson.SAMPLE.json\nThe pricing is pretty generous, in terms of testing things out: 1,000 minutes free each month. Every additional minute is $0.02 -- i.e. transcribing an hour's worth of audio will cost $1.20.\nQuickie Watson Testy!\nBefore you get into the Python stuff, you should see if you are properly initialized with Watson by making contact with it from the command-line (i.e. bash, i.e. uh not sure if it will work on Windows like this):\nIf you don't have a WAV file at hand, you can install the youtube-dl command-line tool:\n$ pip install youtube-dl\n\nAnd then download Trump's Live Free or Die commercial. The following command downloads a movie file, bb4TxjvQlh0.mkv, and extracts a WAV file named bb4TxjvQlh0.wav:\nyoutube-dl \"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=bb4TxjvQlh0\" \\\n  --keep-video \\\n  --extract-audio \\\n  --audio-format wav \\\n  --audio-quality 16K \\\n  --id\nIn the next step, I assume you have a file named bb4TxjvQlh0.wav, but you are free to use any WAV audio file.\n(Note: the whole movie-file thing is totally ancillary...Watson doesn't care if the audio file comes from a movie or you recording into your microphone or whatever. But people like to transcribe videos, which is why I include the step.)\nThis next step is what contacts Watson's API. Replace USERNAME and PASSWORD with whatever credentials you got from the IBM Bluemix Developer Panel.\nThe --data-binary flag wants a file name (prepended with @).\nWhen the audio file is uploaded and Watson returns a response, it will be saved to transcript.json\ncurl -X POST \\\n     -u USERNAME:PASSWORD     \\\n     -o transcript.json        \\\n     --header \"Content-Type: audio\/wav\"    \\\n     --header \"Transfer-Encoding: chunked\" \\\n     --data-binary \"@bb4TxjvQlh0.wav\"        \\\n     \"https:\/\/stream.watsonplatform.net\/speech-to-text\/api\/v1\/recognize?continuous=true&timestamps=true&word_confidence=true&profanity_filter=false\"\nIf this doesn't work for you, then either your Internet is down, Watson is down, or you don't have the proper user\/password credentials.\nPython stuff\nThis project uses:\n\nAnaconda 3-2.4.0\nPython 3.5.1\nRequests\nmoviepy - currently, just being used as a very nice wrapper around ffmpeg, to do audio-video conversion and extraction. But has a lot of potential for laughter and games via programmatic editing.\n\nmoviepy will install ffmpeg if you don't already have it installed\n\n\n\nDemonstrations\nRepublican Debate in South Carolina, Feb. 13, 2016\nCheck out the projects\/republican-debate-sc-2016-02-13 folder in this repo to see the raw JSON response files and their corresponding .WAV audio, as extracted from the Feb. 13, 2016 Republican Presidential Candidate debate in South Carolina:\n\n\n\nDonald Trump \"Live Free or Die\" commercial (39 seconds)\nThe commercial can be seen here on YouTube:\n\n\n\nThe project directory generated: projects\/trump-nh\/\nBecause the video is so short, the directory includes the video file, the extracted audio, as well as the segmented audio and raw Watson JSON responses. For this example, I made the segments 10 seconds long.\nTo compile the transcript text:\nimport json\nfrom glob import glob\nfilenames = glob(\".\/projects\/trump-nh\/transcripts\/*.json\")\n\nfor fn in filenames:\n  with open(fn, 'r') as t:\n      data = json.loads(t.read())\n      for x in data['results']:\n          best_alt = x['alternatives'][0]\n          print(best_alt['transcript'])\nThe result:\n\nthis great slogan of the Hampshire live free or die means so much\nso many people all over the world they use that expression it means liberty it means freedom it means free enterprise\nmean safe\nthe insecurity it means borders it means strong strong military where nobody's going to mess with us it means taking care of our vets\nwhat a great slogan congradulations New Hampshire\n\n\nwonderful job dnmt\nI\nand\n\nNote that the last 3 tokens, dmnt I and, are a result of the Watson API getting confused by the dramatic music that closes the commercial. Luckily, the JSON response includes, among timestamp data for each work, a confidence level as well.\nIt actually is spot on for Trump's full closing sentence (not sure why \"congradulations\" is used...)...the confidence levels for dmnt I and were very low comparatively...I think dmnt is some kind of code word used by the API to indicate something, not that Watson thought that dmnt was actually said (see the full JSON response here)\n{\n    \"word_confidence\": [\n        [\n            \"what\",\n            0.9999999999999674\n        ],\n        [\n            \"a\",\n            0.9999999999999672\n        ],\n        [\n            \"great\",\n            0.999999999999967\n        ],\n        [\n            \"slogan\",\n            0.9964234383591973\n        ],\n        [\n            \"congradulations\",\n            0.7798716606178608\n        ],\n        [\n            \"New\",\n            0.9999999999999933\n        ],\n        [\n            \"Hampshire\",\n            0.9845177369977128\n        ]\n    ]\n}\nPresident Obama weekly address for October 31, 2015 (3 minutes)\nHere's a quick demonstration of Watson's accuracy given a weekly video address from President Obama (~3 minutes):\n\nVideo landing page at Whitehouse.gov\nVideo file: 103115_WeeklyAddress.mp4\nAudio file: 00000-00190.wav\nWatson JSON response: 00000-00190.json\nThe produced file folder: projects\/obama-weekly-address-2015-10-31\/\n\n(because President Obama's video address is just about 3 minutes long, only audio file is extracted, and only one call to Watson's API is made)\nRight now there's just a bunch of sloppy scripts that need to be refactored. There's a script named init.py that you can run from the command-line that will read an existing video file, create a project folder, cut up the audio, and do the transcriptions. It assumes that you have a file named credsfile_watson.json relative to init.py.\nSome code for the commandline, to download the file, then to run init.py:\ncurl -o \"\/tmp\/obama-weekly-address-2015-10-31.mp4\" \\\n  https:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov\/WeeklyAddress\/2015\/103115-QREDSC\/103115_WeeklyAddress.mp4\n\npython init.py \/tmp\/obama-weekly-address-2015-10-31.mp4\nThe output produced by init.py:\n[MoviePy] Writing audio in \/Users\/dtown\/watson-word-watcher\/projects\/obama-weekly-address-2015-10-31\/full-audio.wav\n[MoviePy] Done.                                                                                            \n[MoviePy] Writing audio in \/Users\/dtown\/watson-word-watcher\/projects\/obama-weekly-address-2015-10-31\/audio-segments\/00000-00190.wav\n[MoviePy] Done.  \n\nTranscribe\nThe biggest bottleneck is transcribing the audio.

Throwing a rich text editor control on top of it make it even easier.\nUsage:\n{% load chunks %}\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <title>Test<\/title>\n  <\/head>\n  <body>\n    <h1> Blah blah blah<\/h1>\n    <div id=\"sidebar\">\n        ...\n    <\/div>\n    <div id=\"left\">\n        {% chunk \"home_page_left\" %}\n    <\/div>\n    <div id=\"right\">\n        {% chunk \"home_page_right\" %}\n    <\/div>\n  <\/body>\n<\/html>\n\nif you need the Chunk object in the template (maybe you've added some generic relations to it) you should use the {% get chunk %} templatetag:\n{% load chunks %}\n\n{% get_chunk \"home_page_left\" as chunk_obj %}\n\n<!-- ... use the Chuck object, then display it's contents -->\n<div>{{ chuck_obj.content }}<\/div>\n\nThis is really helpful in those cases where you want to use django.contrib.flatpages but you need multiple content areas.

If you feed images with larger resolution (e.g., ImageNet images), you need to use a different downsampling strategy to keep the memory usage reasonable. See our paper or Torch code for details on ImageNet models.\nThe code in this repo doesn't support BC-structres. However, it should be easy to modify.\nThis code is not the code we use to obtain the results in the original paper, the details (such as input preprocessing, data augmentation, training epochs) may be different. To reproduce the results reported in our paper, see our original Torch implementation.\n\nResults\nThe default setting (L=40, k=12, dropout=0.2) in the code yields a 7.09% error rate on CIFAR10 dataset (without any data augmentation).\nUsage\n\nGet the CIFAR data prepared following the Caffe's official CIFAR tutorial.\nmake_densenet.py contains the code to generate the network and solver prototxt file. First change the data path in function make_net() and preprocessing mean file in function densenet() to your own path of corresponding data file.\nBy default make_densenet.py generates a DenseNet with Depth L=40, Growth rate k=12 and Dropout=0.2. To experiment with different settings, change the code accordingly (see the comments in the code). Example prototxt files are already included. Use python densenet_make.py to generate new prototxt files.\nChange the caffe path in train.sh. Then use sh train.sh to train a DenseNet.\n\nContact\nliuzhuangthu at gmail.com\ngh349 at cornell.edu\nAny discussions, suggestions and questions are welcome!\n","19":"PYCCURACY IS LOOKING FOR A NEW MAINTAINER!\nIf you wish to be the new maintainer leave a message in an issue.\nPyccuracy\nPyccuracy is a Behaviour-Driven-Development-style tool written in Python that aims to make it easier to write automated acceptance tests.

use with Storm. These include a variety of spouts\/bolts for integrating with other systems (Redis, Kafka, MongoDB, etc), as well as code for common tasks a Storm developer encounters.\nFor more information about Storm itself, see the Storm GitHub repository.\nOrganization\nstorm-contrib is organized as a \"super-project\" with a sub-folder for each module. Each module is distributed independently and module owners are responsible for distribution.\n##Git Submodules\nSome storm-contrib modules are git submodules (links to external github repositories). This allows storm-contrib sub-projects to be maintained externally (so those projects can maintain branches and tags independently), but also included in storm-contrib to increase community visibility.\nMore information about how git submodules work can be found in the online git documentation on submodules.\nInitializing storm-contrib submodules\nWhen you clone storm-contrib, the modules that are git submodules will appear as empty directories.\nTo initialize the git submodules use the following command:\ngit submodule init\n\nTo pull down the latest versions of submodules:\ngit submodule update\n\nContributing\nIf you're interested in contributing a module to storm-contrib, send an email to the Storm mailing list. You will then be given commit rights to storm-contrib. The advantage of having your module be part of storm-contrib instead of your own project is more visibility for your code. However, if you'd rather maintain your module as its own project that's fine too!\nAdding your storm-related project as a git submodule\nOnce you have signed the contributor licence agreement and been granted commit rights to storm-contrib, you can add your project as a git submodule with the following command:\ngit submodule add git:\/\/github.com\/[username]\/[projectname].git\n\n","22":"android_volley_examples\nProject with examples how to use the new Volley networking framework\n","23":"jclouds moved to Apache in 2013 and archived this repository.

Icons are infinitely scalable, and customizable with shadows and everything you can do on texts.\nSpecial thanks to Joan Zapata for his android-iconify project since this is mostly a copy :)\nGet started #1\nIf you need icons on a TextView, use the { } syntax.

On the phone, the app appears as a conventional app with a sliding menu and a content pane where fragments are stacked on top of each other. On the tablet, the menu and all other fragments appear in dynamically added panes of varying sizes.\nExample\nExampleActivity demonstrates all the necessary configuration for using PanesActivity.\nExampleFragment uses a layout with two TextViews and a Button. The TextViews hold the index of the fragment and the length of time it's been alive. This is used to demonstrate that fragments are correctly retained on activity restarts. The Button has a callback which creates a new fragment and adds it to the parent activity.\nUsing PanesLibrary\nMake sure you have the most up-to-date support library and ActionBarSherlock.\nHave your activity extend PanesActivity. Then, add fragments to the activity using the following functions:\n\nsetMenuFragment(fragment): set the menu\naddFragment(prevFragment, newFragment): adds newFragment after the prevFragment (clobbering any fragments that used to be after prevFragment)\nclearFragments(): removes all the fragments except the menu fragment\ngetMenuFragment(): get the menu fragment\ngetTopFragment(): get the fragment on the top of the stack\n\nYou also need to provide a PaneSizer. This object allows you to programatically set the width of each pane based on the type of Fragment\/View you want to place inside the pane.\nYou should also implement updateFragment(...). This is run whenever a fragment is added (even on activity restarts).\nFragments are added onto a stack where the 0th fragment is the menu. Here's an example of what this means:\n> setMenuFragment(A)\nstack: A\n\n> addFragment(A, B)\nstack: A, B\n\n> addFragment (B, C)\nstack: A, B, C\n\n> addFragment (C, D)\nstack: A, B, C, D\n\n> addFragment(B, E)\nstack: A, B, E\n\n>clearFragments()\nstack: A\n\nNote: PanesActivity requires you to use fragments. If you don't use fragments, you can still use PanesLayout manually.\nPanesLayout (this controls the tablet layout)\nThe hierarchy of a PanesLayout looks like this:\n|--------------------------------|\n| PanesLayout                    |\n| |----------------------------| |\n| | PaneScrollView             | |\n| | |------------------------| | |\n| | | PaneView |-----------| | | |\n| | |          | (content) | | | |\n| | |          |-----------| | | |\n| | |------------------------| | |\n| |----------------------------| |\n|--------------------------------|\n\nA PanesLayout can hold any number of panes. Each pane is made up of a PaneScrollView (which allows the pane contents to slide left & right), a PaneView (which provides padding on the left of the content), and some content (i.e. fragment).\nVariables associated with each pane:\n\ntype: the possible values of type are defined by the user. For example, in ExampleActivity, the only possible type is DEFAULT_PANE_TYPE. This variable is used to size the pane by the PaneSizer\nfocused: if true, then PanesLayout will never intercept touch events associated with this pane.\nindex: the index of this pane-- starting at 0, going to # of panes - 1.\n\nTo add\/remove\/get panes:\n\naddPane(int type)\naddPane(int type, boolean focused)\nremovePanes(int i): removes all panes after the ith index\ngetNumPanes(): the number of panes\ngetCurrentIndex(): the current top index\nsetIndex(int index): scroll to the pane associated with index.\n\nListeners\/delegates:\n\nPaneSizer: determines what the type\/focus of a pane should be based on some associated object (i.e. Fragment or View)\nOnIndexChangedListener: this is fired whenever the visible panes change.\n\nCopyright 2013 Kenrick Rilee\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n   http:\/\/www.apache.org\/licenses\/LICENSE-2.0\n\n   Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n   distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n   See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n   limitations under the License.\n\n","29":"Lighthouse\nPlease note: this project is no longer maintained.\nLighthouse is a decentralised, peer to peer crowdfunding application that uses the smart contracts features of the\nBitcoin protocol. It lets you create projects and pledge to those projects.\nget involved\nMailing lists:\n\nUser discussion and questions\nDevelopment talk\n\nOr sign up for occasional email newsletters on vinumeris.com.\nYou can chat to us in the #lighthouse chatroom on Freenode IRC.\nIf you're a developer, build instructions are at the end of this README.\nhow to tweak the user interface\nYou can do some work on the UI without being a Java developer. If you have web design experience modifying the Lighthouse\nUI will seem quite familiar. Ask for a binary build if you don't want to compile the app yourself, and then run\nLighthouse with the --resdir=\/path\/to\/ui\/files flag. It should point to the client\/src\/main\/resources\/lighthouse\ndirectory from this git repository. You can use the Shortcut+S key combination to reload the UI whilst the app\nis running. Shortcut is the Cmd key on a Mac and Control key on Windows\/Linux. The UI is defined by the CSS files\nand FXML files (similar to HTML but different language).\nDocumentation:\n\nJavaFX CSS\nFXML is best learned by poking around in the existing code, or reviewing the JavaFX docs in general.\n\nYou can also use the Scene Builder\ntool to do visual UI design. It can't load main.fxml but everything else should open just fine.\nlicense and legal stuff\nThe Lighthouse code is under the Apache license, which allows for commercial derivatives.\nHowever the Lighthouse logo and name are not open. In future the logo images and name may be taken\nout of this repository and put into a proprietary branch. This would be a similar arrangement to Firefox and Chrome.\nThe purpose of this is to ensure that if someone downloads an app called \"Lighthouse\" they know what they are getting\nand that it is not, for example, a fork or patched version of the app that may be broken in some way. If someone were\nto distribute a fork of the app, they would have to create a new name and logo so users can tell the fork apart from\nthe original.\nThus to avoid confusion if you'd like to distribute a version of the project that doesn't match the upstream sources,\nplease invent a new name and logo for it first.

When the event arrives, a block to resume the task is added to its dispatch queue.\n\n\nIncluded abstractions that know how to seamlessly suspend and resume tasks as needed:\n\nChannel: Supports a style of communication between tasks largely inspired by Go's channels and Goroutines.\nPromise: Allows any number of tasks to await a potentially pending result and awakens all of them when one becomes available.\n\nTimer: A Promise that is marked as fulfilled at a specified time.\nFeed: A lazily constructed open-ended series of Promises of a given type wrapped in Optional: after receiving a value from a Promise obtained from a Feed, you can get its successor and await the next value, and repeat until nil is returned, indicating that the feed has ended and won't contain any further values. (Feed implements Sequence so you can iterate over it with a for loop, this is often the most straightforward way to use it.)\n\nAsyncGen: A Task subclass with additional generator-like behavior \u2014 the body function receives a \"post\" function which is used somewhat like yield, but doesn't actually suspend the task; instead it sends values to an internal Feed, which other tasks can subscribe to by iterating over the task object.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n97% elegant! Very minimal abomination content, you should almost never have to encounter it.\n\n\nWarnings\n\n\nHexagen is in early development and pretty experimental to begin with, don't count on the API not changing drastically.\n\n\nYour coroutines should always exit by returning \u2014 you can leave them hanging but you will leak memory. With Swift's lack of exceptions and use of ARC instead of garbage collection, I don't currently see a way to unilaterally tell a coroutine to terminate but still clean up after itself.\n\n\nThe task API needs to account for Cocoa APIs with thread-local behavior in order to make them work coherently and currently doesn't. This may be tricky in the cases of components that don't expose their thread-local variables in any directly manipulable form. Expect it to interact badly with autorelease pools.\n\n\nMore generally, this approach has turned out to be very surprisingly low on complications so far, but the whole thing is still a sketchy self-indulgent hack that violates some basic assumptions that almost all existing Objective-C and Swift code can expect to safely make. It's hard to say what potential interactions I might be overlooking, particularly given that the Swift toolchain is still closed-source. For now, I strongly discourage using this in production code unless you are very, very silly and reasonably confident that you are already going to hell.\n\n\nIf you are under the age of 180\u00ba or find this framework offensive, please don't look at it.\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nHexagen is written for Swift 1.2, first available in Xcode 6.3.\n\n\nCurrently Promises as implemented here are fulfill-only, i.e. there isn't a separate path for errors to take, like there tends to be in other languages' implementations of Promises. This is meant to mirror Swift's overall approach to error handling: to the extent that you need to write Promises that can express error conditions, you should encode that in your own types.\n\n\nIdeas\/Todo\n\nLibrary components\n\nSelect\nTimeouts\nRead-only and write-only views of channels (and promises?)\nElegant task-aware I\/O API\nSubscribe to Cocoa events, notifications, key-value observing, etc. via Promises\/Feeds\nBridges to and from Hexagen features for existing widely-used Swift\/Objective-C concurrency libraries\/frameworks\/approaches\nTask-local storage API\n\n\nInternals\n\nAdapt to use Boost.Context directly once the upcoming version with execution_context is released and Xcode is shipping with usable support for thread_local in clang\/libc++?\n\n\nProject quality\n\nUnit tests\nBenchmarks\nMore examples, better organized examples\n\n\n\nExtra Credit\n\nSide project: implement an alternative framework based on stackless generators (like e.g. Python's built-in yield: a function can only yield from itself to the function that called or most recently reentered it, because it's implemented more like an ordinary function call, getting its own frame on top of the current stack while it's running rather than having a separate stack to switch to).\nImplement exception handling in pure Swift using Hexagen. (Completing this successfully is worth negative points, and I will grudgingly respect you but never fully trust you.)\n\nColophon\nHexagen is released under an MIT license (see LICENSE.md), so you can pretty freely incorporate and redistribute it wherever. The internal context-switching primitive is a thin wrapper around Boost.Coroutine. Boost is free software under a permissive MIT-style license and the parts of it used by Hexagen are already included in this repository.\nMy name is Alice Atlas and I wrote the rest of this, I did it on purpose and I'm not sorry dad\n","32":"shok\nhttp:\/\/shok.io\nThe shok command shell is a non-POSIX interactive command language interpreter with an expressive scripting language.

The intent is to allow client-side programs to directly control the Particle devices in real-time regardless of their programming language. The interface exposed is directly mapped to the one provided by Particle available in their docs section.\nThe VoodooSpark uses the Particle Cloud and its REST API to provide IP address and port information to the local Particle device. It will then initiate a direct connection to the host machine, on which will need to be a TCP server. Once the connection has been made, the host machine can drive the Particle devices using the binary protocol defined below to effectively execute firmware API level commands dynamically.\nLoading the Firmware\nWith your Particle device connected to a Wifi network and has already gone through the \"claim\"\/ownership process:\n\nOpen the Particle.io Editor with the credentials used when going through the claiming process.\nCopy and paste the entire contents of firmware\/voodoospark.cpp into the editor window.\nClick \"Verify\"\nClick \"Flash\"\nOnce the flashing process is complete, close the Particle.io Editor.\n\nAlternately, the firmware may be loaded using the Particle CLI (particle-cli) instead of the Particle.io Editor:\nnpm install -g particle-cli\nparticle cloud login\nparticle cloud flash PARTICLE_DEVICE_ID firmware\/voodoospark.cpp\nNow your Particle device is running VoodooSpark, lets connect to it!\nConnecting the Particle device to You!\nThe way VoodooSpark works is to use the Particle Cloud as a channel to identify where to initiate the TCP connection to the device from your host machine.\nIn order to connect the Particle device to your computer, you will first need to issue an HTTP GET request to the Particle Cloud. This can be done via any programming language, but for this example we are using a simple CURL command. You will need some information outlined with curly braces below, please note the {DEVICE-ID} and {ACCESS-TOKEN} are available from the Particle.io Editor\ncurl https:\/\/api.particle.io\/v1\/devices\/{DEVICE-ID}\/endpoint?access_token={ACCESS-TOKEN}\n\nThis should return a JSON document that looks similar to this:\n{\n  \"cmd\": \"VarReturn\",\n  \"name\": \"endpoint\",\n  \"result\": \"192.168.1.10:48879\",\n  \"coreInfo\": {\n    \"last_app\": \"\",\n    \"last_heard\": \"2014-05-08T02:51:48.826Z\",\n    \"connected\": true,\n    \"deviceID\": \"{DEVICE-ID}\"\n  }\n}\n\nThe \"result\" value is the IP address of the Particle Device on your local network and the part after the colon (:) is the port that the server is currently listening on. This port will by default be 48879 (0xBEEF), but can be changed in the voodoospark firmware. Please do not hardcode the port for this reason, rather use the data returned back as the response.\nWith the IP Address and TCP port information, use your favorite language or TCP client to connect to the device (even telnet will work) and send it the necessary BINARY protocol commands to trigger the desired API interactions as defined in our API Command guide.\nHow to Debug\nIn case you want to see what is going inside the VoodooSpark in real-time, we have built in a lot of debug hooks for you. You will need a USB cable and the screen or minicom utilities (one of them) on unix. Modify the firmware loaded in the Particle build system to convert the line:\n#define DEBUG 0\n\nto the following definition:\n#define DEBUG 1\n\nThis will enable debug mode, boot a serial port connection on the device and present on your computer for you to watch the inside voodoo. Be sure to flash the new firmware to your device, this is very important and easy to miss. Once the flashing finishes, do an\nls \/dev\n\nLook for something similar to tty.usbmodem1411 yours may be different, but will be something like tty.usbmodemABCD. Now using your favorite term app connect to that port using the baud rate of 115200.\nFor screen this command will look like:\nscreen \/dev\/tty.usbmodem1411 115200\n\nReference Implementations\n\nParticle-io node.js\nVspark Go\n\nLicense\nSee LICENSE file.\nMade With Voodoo\nThis firmware is made and cared for by the following awesome people:\n\nChris Williams https:\/\/github.com\/voodootikigod\nRick Waldron https:\/\/github.com\/rwaldron\nDavid Resseguie https:\/\/github.com\/Resseguie\nBrian Genisio https:\/\/github.com\/BrianGenisio\n\n","34":"Tesseract Lib for iOS\nAbout\nThis project contains only the leptonica and tesseract-ocr libraries compiled for iOS.\nThere is no support for armv6, so it won't work with iPhone 1st Gen and iPhone 3G.\nUsage\nYou might want to use this tesseract-ios to include Tesseract in your iOS project.

Then, using the Google Maps API, these locations are translated into geocoordinates and fed into a heatmap. The result is a beautiful and detailed visualization of global positions of a repository's stargazers.\nGetting Started\nRed Dwarf depends on Google Maps for geocoding and mapping. You must get a Google Maps API key to access these services.\nUsage\nImport the Google Maps JavaScript API. Appending libraries=visualization to the source path will ensure that you have the heatmap library available. Replace YOUR_KEY with the API key provided to you by Google.\n<script src=\"http:\/\/maps.googleapis.com\/maps\/api\/js?key=YOUR_KEY&sensor=false&libraries=visualization\"><\/script>\nInstantiate a new RedDwarf object, the constructor of which accepts a configuration object (see Settings).\nvar stars = new RedDwarf({\n\tuser: config.user,\n\trepository: config.repository,\n\tmap_id: config.map_id\n});\nSettings\n\nuser (required)\nThe GitHub user login of the repository owner.\nrepository (required)\nThe GitHub repository name.\nmap_id (required)\nThe ID of the HTML element in which to draw the map.\ncache_location\nThe path (relative or absolute) of a JSON file containing precomputed geolocation data. If omitted, Red Dwarf will compute all data from scratch (see Performance). Note: this file's contents are equivalent to the output of the toJSON method.\nmap_zoom The initial zoom level of the heatmap. Default: 2. (more info)\nmap_lat The initial latitude position on which the heatmap is centered. Default: 20. (20 degrees north of the equator) (more info)\nmap_lng The initial longitude position on which the heatmap is centered. Default: 0. (Prime Meridian) (more info)\nmap_type The initial type of the heatmap: road, satellite, hybrid, or terrain. Default: \"roadmap\". (more info)\n\nMethods\n\ntoJSON Returns a JSON representation of a mapping of string locations to geocodes, the number of repository stars, and a mapping of stargazers' user logins to their respective user objects.\n\nEvents\nRed Dwarf will trigger each of the following events during processing. Arguments passed to the event handlers are listed below the event name (where applicable).\nEvent handlers are defined by including functions keyed by the respective event name in the settings object.\n\nonRepositoryLoaded Fired after successfully loading repository info from the GitHub API.\n\ndata The data object returned by GitHub.\n\n\nonRepositoryError Fired after unsuccessfully loading repository info from the GitHub API.\n\nmessage The error message returned by GitHub.\n\n\nonCacheLoaded Fired after successfully loading the JSON cache file.\nonStargazersUpdated Fired after processing a chunk of at most 100 repository stargazers.\n\nnum_stargazers The number of stargazers processed so far.\n\n\nonStargazersLoaded Fired after successfully loading all stargazers.\nonLocationUpdated Fired after successfully loading a single stargazer's profile.\n\nnum_resolved_stargazers The number of stargazers whose profiles have been loaded so far.\nnum_stargazers The total number of profiles to load.\n\n\nonLocationLoaded Fired after successfully loading all stargazers' profiles.\nonPointsUpdated Fired after geocoding a chunk of at most 10 stargazer locations.\n\nnum_resolved_points The number of locations geocoded so far.\nnum_stargazers The total number of locations to geocode.\n\n\nonPointsLoaded Fired after successfully geocoding all locations and drawing the heatmap.\n\nPerformance\nIt's important to pre-cache the geolocation data because the Google Maps geocoding API places strict limits on the frequency of requests. Trial and error indicates that this limit is in the neighborhood of 40 requests per minute. This means a repository with 200 stars would take 5 minutes to get all geocoordinates. By default, Red Dwarf rate limits requests using a technique based on work by Nicholas Zakas.\nAlso note that repositories with many thousands of stargazers will likely hit usage limits on GitHub's API, because each stargazer's profile must be queried in order to get their location. Rate limiting is currently in development for this scenario.\nFor these reasons, it's best to pre-cache as frequently as possible. This will prevent each page load from incurring the usage limit penalizations.\nRed Dwarf will only make API calls for data not already in the cache.\nPrivacy\nRed Dwarf uses publicly-available stargazer information including login names and locations via the GitHub API. Locations are only derived from stargazers who have opted in to making their location public in their GitHub profile.\nMIT License\nCopyright (c) 2012 Rick Viscomi (rviscomi@gmail.com)\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and\/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

For these, you'll want to use globalSetUp and globalTearDown.\n\nWhen do I use setUp \/ tearDown?\n\nWhen a suite's runtime environment does not influence other running suites.\n\n\nWhen do I use globalSetUp \/ globalTearDown ?\n\nWhen a suite's runtime environment can potentially interfere with other, concurrently running suites.\nExample: Attempting to run multiple suites in parallel which rely on a Cassandra schema being in place, and each attempting to reset the schema to a known state on a single Cassandra instance, you'll get Cassandra schema version errors.  Using globalSetUp prevents this by running the schema reset code exactly once for all tests.\n\n\n\nTest File Examples\nA simple example (success):\nvar called = 0;\n\nexports.test_async_one_equals_one = function(test, assert) {\n  setTimeout(function() {\n    assert.equal(1, 1);\n    called++;\n    test.finish();\n  }, 1000);\n};\n\nexports.tearDown = function(test, assert) {\n  assert.equal(called, 1);\n  test.finish();\n};\nA simple example (skipping a test):\nvar dbUp = false;\n\nexports.test_query = function(test, assert) {\n  if (!dbUp) {\n    test.skip('Database is not up, skipping...');\n    return;\n  }\n\n  assert.equal(2, 1);\n  test.finish();\n};\nA simple example (failure):\nexports.test_two_equals_one = function(test, assert) {\n  assert.equal(2, 1);\n  test.finish();\n};\nA simple example using the optional BDD module:\nvar bdd = require('whiskey').bdd.init(exports);\nvar describe = bdd.describe;\n\ndescribe('the bdd module', function(it) {\n  it('supports it(), expect(), and toEqual()', function(expect) {\n    expect(true).toEqual(true);\n  });\n});\nA simple example demonstrating how to use global setup and teardown functionality:\nexports['globalSetUp'] = function(test, assert) {\n  \/\/ Set up database schema here...\n  \/\/ Push known data set to database here...\n  test.finish();\n}\n\nexports['globalTearDown'] = function(test, assert) {\n  \/\/ Drop database here...\n  test.finish();\n}\nFor more examples please check the example\/ folder, and the test\/run.sh script.\nBuild status\n\nRunning Whiskey test suite\nTo run the Whiskey test suite, run the following command in the repository root\ndirectory.\nnpm test\nIf all the tests have sucessfully passed, the process should exit with a zero\nstatus code and you should see * * * Whiskey test suite PASSED. * * *\nmessage.\nContributing\nTo contribute, fork the repository, create a branch with your changes and open a\npull request.\nDebugging\nIf you want to debug your test, you can use the --debug option. This will\ncause Whiskey to start the test process with the V8 debugger functionality.\nYou then need to manually connect to the debugger to control it (i.e. using\nnode repl or node-inspector).\nWhiskey will also by default set a breakpoint at the beginning of your test\nfile.\nNote: This option can only be used with a single test file.  Further, you\ncannot use the --debug and --independent-tests options together.  The\nsemantics just don't make any sense.  To debug a test, make sure you invoke it\nwith --tests instead.\nTroubleshooting\nI use long-stack-straces module in my own code and all of the tests get reported as succeeded\nLong stack traces modules intercepts the default Error object and throws a custom\none. The problem with this is that Whiskey internally relies on attaching the\ntest name to the Error object so it can figure out to which test the exception\nbelongs. long-stack-traces throws a custom Error object and as a consequence test\nname attribute gets lost so Whiskey thinks your test didn't throw any exceptions.\nThe solution for this problem is to disable long-stack-trace module when running\nthe tests. This shouldn't be a big deal, because Whiskey internally already uses\nlong-stack-traces module which means that you will still get long stack traces\nin the exceptions which were thrown in your tests.\nMy test gets reported as \"timeout\" instead of \"failure\"\nIf your test gets reported as \"timeout\" instead of \"failure\" your test code most\nlikely looks similar to the one below:\nexports.test_failure = function(test, assert){\n  setTimeout(function() {\n    throw \"blaaaaah\";\n    test.finish();\n  },200);\n};\nThe problem with this is that if you run tests in parallel (--concurrency > 1)\nand you don't use a custom assert object which gets passed to each test function,\nWhiskey can't figure out to which test the exception belongs. As a consequence,\nthe test is reported as \"timed out\" and the exception is reported as \"uncaught\".\nThe solution for this problem is to run the tests in sequential mode (drop the\n--concurrency option).\nLicense\nApache 2.0, for more info see LICENSE.\n","47":"flux-router-component\nNotice: This package is deprecated in favor of fluxible-router.\n\n\n\n\n\nProvides navigational React components (NavLink), router mixin (RouterMixin), and action navigateAction for applications built with Flux architecture.  Please check out examples of how to use these components.\nContext and Expected Context Methods\nBefore we explain how to use NavLink and RouterMixin, lets start with two methods they expect:\n\nexecuteAction(navigateAction, payload) - This executes navigate action, switches the app to the new route, and update the url.\nmakePath(routeName, routeParams) - This is used to generate url for a given route.\n\nThese two methods need to be available in:\n\nthe React context of the component (access via this.context in the component), or\nthe context prop of the component (this.props.context)\nIf exists in both this.context and this.props.context, the one in this.context takes higher precedence.\n\nAn example of such context is the ComponentContext provided by fluxible-plugin-routr, which is a plugin for fluxible.  We have a more sophisticated example application, fluxible-router, showing how everything works together.\nNote that React context is an undocumented feature, so its API could change without notice.  Here is a blog from Dave King that explains what it is and how to use it.\nNavLink\nDocs\nRouterMixin\nDocs\nnavigateAction\nDocs\nHistory Management (Browser Support and Hash-Based Routing)\nConsidering different application needs and different browser support levels for pushState, this library provides the following options for browser history management:\n\nUse History provided by this library (Default)\nUse HistoryWithHash provided by this library\nIn addition, you can also customize it to use your own\n\nHistory\nThis is the default History implementation RouterMixin uses.  It is a straight-forward implementation that:\n\nuses pushState\/replaceState when they are available in the browser.\nFor the browsers without pushState support, History simply refreshes the page by setting window.location.href = url for pushState, and calling window.location.replace(url) for replaceState.\n\nHistoryWithHash\nUsing hash-based url for client side routing has a lot of known issues.  History.js describes those issues pretty well.\nBut as always, there will be some applications out there that have to use it.  This implementation provides a solution.\nIf you do decide to use hash route, it is recommended to enable checkRouteOnPageLoad.  Because hash fragment (that contains route) does not get sent to the server side, RouterMixin will compare the route info from server and route in the hash fragment.  On route mismatch, it will dispatch a navigate action on browser side to load the actual page content for the route represented by the hash fragment.\nuseHashRoute Config\nYou can decide when to use hash-based routing through the useHashRoute option:\n\nuseHashRoute=true to force to use hash routing for all browsers, by setting useHashRoute to true when creating the HistoryWithHash instance;\nunspecified, i.e. omitting the setting, to only use hash route for browsers without native pushState support;\nuseHashRoute=false to turn off hash routing for all browsers.\n\n\n\n\n\nuseHashRoute = true\nuseHashRoute = false\nuseHashRoute unspecified\n\n\n\n\nBrowsers with pushState support\nhistory.pushState with \/home#\/path\/to\/pageB\nhistory.pushState with \/path\/to\/pageB\nSame as useHashRoute = false\n\n\nBrowsers without pushState support\npage refresh to \/home#\/path\/to\/pageB\npage refresh to \/path\/to\/pageB\nSame as useHashRoute = true\n\n\n\nCustom Transformer for Hash Fragment\nBy default, the hash fragments are just url paths.  With HistoryWithHash, you can transform it to whatever syntax you need by passing props.hashRouteTransformer to the base React component that RouterMixin is mixed into.  See the example below for how to configure it.\nExample\nThis is an example of how you can use and configure HistoryWithHash:\nvar RouterMixin = require('flux-router-component').RouterMixin;\nvar HistoryWithHash = require('flux-router-component\/utils').HistoryWithHash;\n\nvar Application = React.createClass({\n    mixins: [RouterMixin],\n    ...\n});\n\nvar appComponent = Application({\n    ...\n    historyCreator: function historyCreator() {\n        return new HistoryWithHash({\n            \/\/ optional. Defaults to true if browser does not support pushState; false otherwise.\n            useHashRoute: true,\n            \/\/ optional. Defaults to '\/'. Used when url has no hash fragment\n            defaultHashRoute: '\/default',\n            \/\/ optional. Transformer for custom hash route syntax\n            hashRouteTransformer: {\n                transform: function (original) {\n                    \/\/ transform url hash fragment from '\/new\/path' to 'new-path'\n                    var transformed = original.replace('\/', '-').replace(\/^(\\-+)\/, '');\n                    return transformed;\n                },\n                reverse: function (transformed) {\n                    \/\/ reverse transform from 'new-path' to '\/new\/path'\n                    var original = '\/' + (transformed && transformed.replace('-', '\/'));\n                    return original;\n                }\n            }\n        });\n    }\n});\nProvide Your Own History Manager\nIf none of the history managers provided in this library works for your application, you can also customize the RouterMixin to use your own history manager implementation.  Please follow the same API as History.\nAPI\nPlease use History.js and HistoryWithHash.js as examples.\n\non(listener)\noff(listener)\ngetUrl()\ngetState()\npushState(state, title, url)\nreplaceState(state, title, url)\n\nExample:\nvar RouterMixin = require('flux-router-component').RouterMixin;\nvar MyHistory = require('MyHistoryManagerIsAwesome');\n\nvar Application = React.createClass({\n    mixins: [RouterMixin],\n    ...\n});\n\nvar appComponent = Application({\n    ...\n    historyCreator: function historyCreator() {\n        return new MyHistory();\n    }\n});\nScroll Position Management\nRouterMixin has a built-in mechanism for managing scroll position upon page navigation, for modern browsers that support native history state:\n\nreset scroll position to (0, 0) when user clicks on a link and navigates to a new page, and\nrestore scroll position to last visited state when user clicks forward and back buttons to navigate between pages.\n\nIf you want to disable this behavior, you can set enableScroll prop to false for RouterMixin.  This is an example of how it can be done:\nvar RouterMixin = require('flux-router-component').RouterMixin;\n\nvar Application = React.createClass({\n    mixins: [RouterMixin],\n    ...\n});\n\nvar appComponent = Application({\n    ...\n    enableScroll: false\n});\nonbeforeunload Support\nThe History API does not allow popstate events to be cancelled, which results in window.onbeforeunload() methods not being triggered.  This is problematic for users, since application state could be lost when they navigate to a certain page without knowing the consequences.\nOur solution is to check for a window.onbeforeunload() method, prompt the user with window.confirm(), and then navigate to the correct route based on the confirmation.  If a route is cancelled by the user, we reset the page URL back to the original URL by using  the History pushState() method.\nTo implement the window.onbeforeunload() method, you need to set it within the components that need user verification before leaving a page.  Here is an example:\ncomponentDidMount: function() {\n  window.onbeforeunload = function () {\n    return 'Make sure to save your changes before leaving this page!';\n  }\n}\nPolyfills\naddEventListener and removeEventListener polyfills are provided by:\n\nCompatibility code example on Mozilla Developer Network\nA few DOM polyfill libaries listed on Modernizer Polyfill wiki page.\n\nArray.prototype.reduce and Array.prototype.map (used by dependent library, query-string) polyfill examples are provided by:\n\nMozilla Developer Network Array.prototype.reduce polyfill\nMozilla Developer Network Array.prototype.map polyfill\n\nYou can also look into this polyfill.io polyfill service.\nCompatible React Versions\n\n\n\nCompatible React Version\nflux-router-component Version\n\n\n\n\n0.12\n>= 0.4.1\n\n\n0.11\n< 0.4\n\n\n\nLicense\nThis software is free to use under the Yahoo!

Ideally all media (graphics, css, scripts) development would\noccur locally and not use production media. Then, when ready to deploy, the\nmedia should be pushed to production. That way there can be significant changes\nto media without disturbing the production web site.\nThe goal of mediasync is to develop locally and then flip a switch in production\nthat makes all the media URLs point to remote media URLs instead of the local\nmedia directory.\nAll code is under a BSD-style license, see LICENSE for details.\nSource: http:\/\/github.com\/sunlightlabs\/django-mediasync\/\n\nRequirements\n\ndjango >= 1.0\nboto >= 1.8d\nslimmer == 0.1.30 (optional)\npython-cloudfiles == 1.7.5 (optional, for Rackspace Cloud Files backend)\n\n\nUpgrading from mediasync 1.x\n\nUpdate your mediasync settings as described in the next section.\n\nRun .\/manage.py syncmedia --force to force updates of all files:\n\ngzip instead of deflate compression\nsync both compressed and original versions of files\n\n\n\n\nadd \"django.core.context_processors.request\" to TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS\n\n\nAn important note about Django 1.3\nWhen DEBUG = True and the project is run with manage.py runserver, Django 1.3\nautomatically adds django.views.static.serve to urlpatterns. While this feature\nmakes local development easier for most people, it screws everything up if\nyou've added mediasync.urls to urlpatterns. As of now, the only way I can find\nto disable the automatic addition of django.views.static.serve is to use a full\nURL for STATIC_URL instead of just a path:\nSTATIC_URL = \"http:\/\/localhost:8000\/static\/\"\n\n\nConfiguration\n\nsettings.py\nAdd to INSTALLED_APPS:\n'mediasync'\n\nAdd to TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS:\n'django.core.context_processors.request'\n\nMake sure your STATIC_ROOT setting is the correct path to your media:\nSTATIC_ROOT = '\/path\/to\/media'\n\nWhen media is being served locally (instead of from S3 or Cloud Files),\nmediasync serves media through a Django view. Set your STATIC_URL to what\nyou'd like that local media URL to be. This can be whatever you'd like, as long\nas you're using the {% media_url %} tag (more details on this later):\nSTATIC_URL = 'http:\/\/localhost:8000\/devmedia\/'\n\nSTATIC_URL is the URL that will be used in debug mode. Otherwise,\nthe STATIC_URL will be loaded from the backend settings. Please see\nAn important note about Django 1.3.\nThe following settings dict must also be added:\nMEDIASYNC = {\n    'BACKEND': 'path.to.backend',\n}\n\nIf you want to use a different media URL than that specified\nin settings.STATIC_URL, you can add STATIC_URL to the MEDIASYNC\nsettings dict:\nMEDIASYNC = {\n    ...\n    'STATIC_URL': '\/url\/to\/media\/', # becomes http:\/\/yourhost.com\/url\/to\/media\/\n    ...\n}\n\nSame goes for STATIC_ROOT:\nMEDIASYNC = {\n    ...\n    'STATIC_ROOT': '\/path\/to\/media\/',\n    ...\n}\n\nmediasync supports pluggable backends. Please see below for information on\nthe provided backends as well as directions on implementing your own.\n\nMedia expiration\nIf the client supports media expiration, all files are set to expire 365 days\nafter the file was synced. You may override this value by adding\nEXPIRATION_DAYS to the MEDIASYNC settings dict.\n# Expire in 10 years.\nMEDIASYNC['EXPIRATION_DAYS'] = 365 * 10\n\n\nServing media remote (S3\/Cloud Files) or locally\nThe media URL is selected based on the SERVE_REMOTE attribute in the\nMEDIASYNC dict in settings.py. When False, media will be served locally\ninstead of from S3.\n# This would force mediasync to serve all media through the value\n# specified in settings.STATIC_URL.\nMEDIASYNC['SERVE_REMOTE'] = False\n\n# This would serve all media through S3\/Cloud Files.\nMEDIASYNC['SERVE_REMOTE'] = True\n\n# This would serve media locally while in DEBUG mode, and remotely when\n# in production (DEBUG == False).\nMEDIASYNC['SERVE_REMOTE'] = not DEBUG\n\nWhen serving files locally, you can emulate the CSS\/JS combo\/minifying\nbehavior we get from using media processors by specifying the following.\nMEDIASYNC['SERVE_REMOTE'] = False\nMEDIASYNC['EMULATE_COMBO'] = True\n\nNote that this will only work if your STATIC_URL is pointing at your\nDjango dev server. Also keep in mind that some processors may take a while,\nand is best used to check things over before rolling out to production.\n\nDOCTYPE\nlink and script tags are written using XHTML syntax. The rendering can be\noverridden by using the DOCTYPE setting. Allowed values are 'html4',\n'html5', or 'xhtml'. The default in mediasync 2.0 is html5, just as\nthe DOCTYPE on your site should be.\nMEDIASYNC['DOCTYPE'] = 'html5'\n\nFor each doctype, the following tags are rendered:\n\nhtml4\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"...\" type=\"text\/css\" media=\"...\">\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"...\"><\/script>\n\n\nhtml5\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"...\" media=\"...\">\n<script src=\"...\"><\/script>\n\n\nxhtml\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"...\" type=\"text\/css\" media=\"...\" \/>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"...\"><\/script>\n\n\nSSL\nmediasync will attempt to intelligently determine if your media should be\nserved using HTTPS. In order to use automatic SSL detection,\ndjango.core.context_processors.request must be added to\nTEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS in settings.py:\nTEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS = (\n    ...\n    'django.core.context_processors.request',\n    ...\n)\n\nThe USE_SSL mediasync setting can be used to override the SSL\nURL detection.\n# Force HTTPS.\nMEDIASYNC['USE_SSL'] = True\n\nor\n# Force HTTP.\nMEDIASYNC['USE_SSL'] = False\n\nSome backends will be unable to use SSL. In these cases USE_SSL and SSL\ndetection will be ignored.\n\nurls.py\nTo serve local media through mediasync, add a reference to mediasync.urls in\nyour main urls.py file.\nurlpatterns = ('',\n    ...\n    url(r'^', include('mediasync.urls)),\n    ...\n)\n\n\nBackends\nmediasync now supports pluggable backends. A backend is a Python module that\ncontains a Client class that implements a mediasync-provided BaseClient class.\n\nS3\nMEDIASYNC['BACKEND'] = 'mediasync.backends.s3'\n\n\nSettings\nThe following settings are required in the mediasync settings dict:\nMEDIASYNC = {\n    'AWS_KEY': \"s3_key\",\n    'AWS_SECRET': \"s3_secret\",\n    'AWS_BUCKET': \"bucket_name\",\n}\n\nOptionally you may specify a path prefix:\nMEDIASYNC['AWS_PREFIX'] = \"key_prefix\"\n\nAssuming a correct DNS CNAME entry, setting AWS_BUCKET to\nassets.sunlightlabs.com and AWS_PREFIX to myproject\/media would\nsync the media directory to http:\/\/assets.sunlightlabs.com\/myproject\/media\/.\nAmazon allows users to create DNS CNAME entries to map custom domain names\nto an AWS bucket. MEDIASYNC can be configured to use the bucket as the media\nURL by setting AWS_BUCKET_CNAME to True.\nMEDIASYNC['AWS_BUCKET_CNAME'] = True\n\nIf you would prefer to not use gzip compression with the S3 client, it can be\ndisabled:\nMEDIASYNC['AWS_GZIP'] = False\n\n\nTips\nSince files are given a far future expires header, one needs a way to do\n\"cache busting\" when you want the browser to fetch new files before the expire\ndate arrives.  One of the best and easiest ways to accomplish this is to alter\nthe path to the media files with some sort of version string using the key\nprefix setting:\nMEDIASYNC['AWS_PREFIX'] = \"myproject\/media\/v20001201\"\n\nGiven that and the above DNS CNAME example, the media directory URL would end\nup being http:\/\/assets.sunlightlabs.com\/myproject\/media\/v20001201\/.  Whenever\nyou need to update the media files, simply update the key prefix with a new\nversioned string.\nA CACHE_BUSTER settings can be added to the main MEDIASYNC settings\ndict to add a query string parameter to all media URLs. The cache buster can\neither be a value or a callable which is passed the media URL as a parameter.\nMEDIASYNC['CACHE_BUSTER'] = 1234567890\n\nThe above setting will generate a media path similar to:\nhttp:\/\/yourhost.com\/url\/to\/media\/image.png?1234567890\n\nAn important thing to note is that if you're running your Django site in a\nmulti-threaded or multi-node setup, you'll want to be careful about using a\ntime-based cache buster value. Each worker\/thread will probably have a slightly\ndifferent value for datetime.now(), which means your users will find themselves\nhaving cache misses randomly from page to page.\n\nRackspace Cloud Files\nMEDIASYNC['BACKEND'] = 'mediasync.backends.cloudfiles'\n\n\nSettings\nThe following settings are required in the mediasync settings dict:\nMEDIASYNC = {\n    'CLOUDFILES_CONTAINER': 'container_name',\n    'CLOUDFILES_USERNAME': 'cf_username',\n    'CLOUDFILES_API_KEY': 'cf_apikey',\n}\n\n\nTips\nThe Cloud Files backend lacks support for the following features:\n\nsetting HTTP Expires header\nsetting HTTP Cache-Control header\ncontent compression (gzip)\nSSL support\nconditional sync based on file checksum\n\n\nCustom backends\nYou can create a custom backend by creating a Python module containing a Client\nclass. This class must inherit from mediasync.backends.BaseClient. Additionally,\nyou must implement two methods:\ndef remote_media_url(self, with_ssl):\n    ...\n\nremote_media_url returns the full base URL for remote media. This can be\neither a static URL or one generated from mediasync settings:\ndef put(self, filedata, content_type, remote_path, force=False):\n    ...\n\nput is responsible for pushing a file to the backend storage.\n\nfiledata - the contents of the file\ncontent_type - the mime type of the file\nremote_path - the remote path (relative from remote_media_url) to which\nthe file should be written\nforce - if True, write file to remote storage even if it already exists\n\nIf the client supports gzipped content, you will need to override supports_gzip\nto return True:\ndef supports_gzip(self):\n        return True\n\n\nFile Processors\nFile processors allow you to modify the content of a file as it is being\nsynced or served statically.\nMediasync ships with three processor modules:\n\nslim is a minifier written in Python and requires the\nslimmer Python package. The Python package can be found here:\nhttp:\/\/pypi.python.org\/pypi\/slimmer\/\nyuicompressor is a minifier written in Java and can be downloaded\nfrom YUI's download page: http:\/\/developer.yahoo.com\/yui\/compressor\/.\nThis processor also requires an additional setting, as defined below.\nyuicompressor is new and should be considered experimental until\nthe mediasync 2.1 release.\nclosurecompiler is a javascript compiler provided by Google.\n\nCustom processors can be specified using the PROCESSORS entry in the\nmediasync settings dict. PROCESSORS should be a list of processor entries.\nEach processor entry can be a callable or a string path to a callable. If the\npath is to a class definition, the class will be instantiated into an object.\nThe processor callable should return a string of the processed file data, None\nif it chooses to not process the file, or raise mediasync.SyncException if\nsomething goes terribly wrong. The callable should take the following arguments:\ndef proc(filedata, content_type, remote_path, is_active):\n        ...\n\n\nfiledata\nthe content of the file as a string\ncontent_type\nthe mimetype of the file being processed\nremote_path\nthe path to which the file is being synced (contains the file name)\nis_active\nTrue if the processor should... process\n\nIf the PROCESSORS setting is used, you will need to include the defaults\nif you plan on using them:\n'PROCESSORS': (\n    'mediasync.processors.slim.css_minifier',\n    'mediasync.processors.slim.js_minifier',\n        ...\n),\n\nmediasync will attempt to use slimmer by default if you have the package\ninstalled and do not use the PROCESSORS setting.\n\nGoogle Closure Compiler\nGoogle's JavaScript Closure Compiler provides an API that allows files to be\ncompressed without installing anything locally. To use the service:\n'PROCESSORS': ('mediasync.processors.closurecompiler.compile',)\n\n\nYUI Compressor\nTo configure YUI Compressor you need to define a PROCESSORS and\nYUI_COMPRESSOR_PATH as follows, assuming you placed the \".jar\" file in\nyour ~\/bin path:\n'PROCESSORS': ('mediasync.processors.yuicompressor.css_minifier',\n               'mediasync.processors.yuicompressor.js_minifier'),\n'YUI_COMPRESSOR_PATH': '~\/bin\/yuicompressor.jar',\n\n\nFeatures\n\nIgnored Directories\nAny directory in STATIC_ROOT that is hidden or starts with an underscore\nwill be ignored during syncing.\n\nTemplate Tags\nWhen referring to media in HTML templates you can use custom template tags.\nThese tags can by accessed by loading the media template tag collection.\n{% load media %}\n\nAny tag that has a path argument can use either a string or a variable:\n{% media_url \"images\/avatar.png\" }\n{% media_url user.profile.avatar_path %}\n\nSome backends (S3) support https URLs when the requesting page is secure.\nIn order for the https to be detected, the request must be placed in the\ntemplate context with the key 'request'. This can be done automatically by\nadding 'django.core.context_processors.request' to TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS\nin settings.py\n\nmedia_url\nRenders the STATIC_URL from settings.py with trailing slashes removed.\n<img src=\"{% media_url %}\/images\/stuff.png\">\n\nSTATIC_URL takes an optional argument that is the media path. Using the argument\nallows mediasync to add the CACHE_BUSTER to the URL if one is specified.\n<img src=\"{% media_url '\/images\/stuff.png' %}\">\n\nIf CACHE_BUSTER is set to 12345, the above example will render as:\n<img src=\"http:\/\/assets.example.com\/path\/to\/media\/images\/stuff.png?12345\">\n\nNOTE: Don't use this tag to serve CSS or JS files. Use the js and css tags\nthat were specifically designed for the purpose.\n\njs\nRenders a script tag with the correct include.\n{% js \"myfile.js\" %}\n\n\ncss\nRenders a <link> tag to include the stylesheet. It takes an optional second\nparameter for the media attribute; the default media is \"screen, projector\".\n{% css \"myfile.css\" %}\n{% css \"myfile.css\" \"screen\" %}\n\n\ncss_print\nShortcut to render as a print stylesheet.\n{% css_print \"myfile.css\" %}\n\nwhich is equivalent to\n{% css \"myfile.css\" \"print\" %}\n\n\nWriting Style Sheets\nUsers are encouraged to write stylesheets using relative URLS. The media\ndirectory is synced with S3 as is, so relative local paths will still work\nwhen pushed remotely.\nbackground: url(..\/images\/arrow_left.png);\n\n\nJoined files\nWhen serving media in production, it is beneficial to combine JavaScript and\nCSS into single files. This reduces the number of connections the browser needs\nto make to the web server. Fewer connections can dramatically decrease page\nload times and reduce the server-side load.\nJoined files are specified in the MEDIASYNC dict using JOINED. This is\na dict that maps individual media to an alias for the joined files.\n'JOINED': {\n    'styles\/joined.css': ['styles\/reset.css','styles\/text.css'],\n    'scripts\/joined.js': ['scripts\/jquery.js','scripts\/processing.js'],\n},\n\nFiles listed in JOINED will be combined and pushed to S3 with the name of\nthe alias. The individual CSS files will also be pushed to S3. Aliases must end\nin either .css or .js in order for the content-type to be set appropriately.\nThe existing template tags may be used to refer to the joined media. Simply use\nthe joined alias as the argument:\n{% css_print \"joined.css\" %}\n\nWhen served locally, template tags will render an HTML tag for each of the files\nthat make up the joined file:\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"\/media\/styles\/reset.css\" type=\"text\/css\" media=\"screen, projection\" \/>\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"\/media\/styles\/text.css\" type=\"text\/css\" media=\"screen, projection\" \/>\n\nWhen served remotely, one HTML tag will be rendered with the name of the joined file:\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"http:\/\/bucket.s3.amazonaws.com\/styles\/joined.css\" type=\"text\/css\" media=\"screen, projection\" \/>\n\n\nSmart GZIP for S3\nIn previous versions of mediasync's S3 client, certain content was always pushed\nin a compressed format. This can cause major issues with clients that do not\nsupport gzip. New in version 2.0, mediasync will push both a gzipped and an\nuncompressed version of the file to S3. The template tags look at the request\nand direct the user to the appropriate file based on the ACCEPT_ENCODING HTTP\nheader. Assuming a file styles\/layout.css, the following would be synced to S3:\nstyles\/layout.css\nstyles\/layout.css.gzt\n\nNote the altered use of the .gz extension. Some versions of the Safari browser\non OSX ignore the Content-Type header for files ending in .gz and treat them\ninstead as files to download. This altered extension allows Safari to deflate\nand utilize the files correctly without affecting functionality in any other\ntested browsers.\n\nSignals\nmediasync provides two signals that allow you to hook into the syncing\nprocess. pre_sync is sent after the client is opened, but before the first\nfile is synced. post_sync is sent after the last file is synced, but before\nthe client is closed. This allows you to call commands on the client without\nhaving to worry about its state. The signals allow you to do common tasks such\nas calling Django 1.3's collectstatic command, process SASS stylesheets, or\nclean up files generated during a pre_sync process.\n\ncollectstatic receiver\nA receiver for calling the collectstatic management command is provided:\nfrom mediasync.signals import pre_sync, collectstatic_receiver\n\n# run collectstatic before syncing media\npre_sync.connect(collectstatic_receiver)\n\n\nSASS receiver\nA receiver for compiling SASS into CSS is provided:\nfrom mediasync.signals import pre_sync, sass_receiver\n\n# compile SASS files before syncing media\npre_sync.connect(sass_receiver)\n\nAny file in static root that has the sass or scss file extension will be\ncompiled into CSS. The compiled CSS file will be placed in the same directory\nand the original extension will be replaced with css. If a file exists with\nthe same css extension, it will be overwritten.\nBy default mediasync uses the sass command with no options. If you would\nlike to specify your own command, specify SASS_COMMAND in settings:\nMEDIASYNC = {\n    ...\n    'SASS_COMMAND': 'sass -scss -l',\n    ...\n}\n\n\nRunning MEDIASYNC\n.\/manage.py syncmedia\n\n\nChange Log\n\n2.2.0\n\nadded pre_sync and post_sync signals\nprovide basic receiver for calling collectstatic before syncing\nprovide receiver for compiling SASS before syncing\nshow media directory listing when serving locally in debug mode\nadd processor for Google's Closure Compiler API for JavaScript\ntemplate tags can now take a variable as the path argument\n\n\n2.1.0\n\ndefault to using STATIC_URL and STATIC_ROOT (Django 1.3), falling back\nto MEDIA_URL and MEDIA_ROOT if the STATIC_* settings are not set\nadd AWS_GZIP setting to optionally disable gzip compression in S3 client\n\nThanks to Rob Hudson and Dolan Antenucci for their contributions to this\nrelease.\n\n2.0.0\n\nupdated Rackspace Cloud Files backend\nuse gzip instead of deflate for compression (better browser support)\nsmart gzip client support detection\nadd pluggable backends\nadd pluggable file processors\nexperimental YUI Compressor\nsettings refactor\nallow override of settings.MEDIA_URL\nImprovements to the logic that decides which files to sync.

Ideally all media (graphics, css, scripts) development would\noccur locally and not use production media. Then, when ready to deploy, the\nmedia should be pushed to production. That way there can be significant changes\nto media without disturbing the production web site.\nThe goal of mediasync is to develop locally and then flip a switch in production\nthat makes all the media URLs point to remote media URLs instead of the local\nmedia directory.\nAll code is under a BSD-style license, see LICENSE for details.\nSource: http:\/\/github.com\/sunlightlabs\/django-mediasync\/\n\nRequirements\n\ndjango >= 1.0\nboto >= 1.8d\nslimmer == 0.1.30 (optional)\npython-cloudfiles == 1.7.5 (optional, for Rackspace Cloud Files backend)\n\n\nUpgrading from mediasync 1.x\n\nUpdate your mediasync settings as described in the next section.\n\nRun .\/manage.py syncmedia --force to force updates of all files:\n\ngzip instead of deflate compression\nsync both compressed and original versions of files\n\n\n\n\nadd \"django.core.context_processors.request\" to TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS\n\n\nAn important note about Django 1.3\nWhen DEBUG = True and the project is run with manage.py runserver, Django 1.3\nautomatically adds django.views.static.serve to urlpatterns. While this feature\nmakes local development easier for most people, it screws everything up if\nyou've added mediasync.urls to urlpatterns. As of now, the only way I can find\nto disable the automatic addition of django.views.static.serve is to use a full\nURL for STATIC_URL instead of just a path:\nSTATIC_URL = \"http:\/\/localhost:8000\/static\/\"\n\n\nConfiguration\n\nsettings.py\nAdd to INSTALLED_APPS:\n'mediasync'\n\nAdd to TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS:\n'django.core.context_processors.request'\n\nMake sure your STATIC_ROOT setting is the correct path to your media:\nSTATIC_ROOT = '\/path\/to\/media'\n\nWhen media is being served locally (instead of from S3 or Cloud Files),\nmediasync serves media through a Django view. Set your STATIC_URL to what\nyou'd like that local media URL to be. This can be whatever you'd like, as long\nas you're using the {% media_url %} tag (more details on this later):\nSTATIC_URL = 'http:\/\/localhost:8000\/devmedia\/'\n\nSTATIC_URL is the URL that will be used in debug mode. Otherwise,\nthe STATIC_URL will be loaded from the backend settings. Please see\nAn important note about Django 1.3.\nThe following settings dict must also be added:\nMEDIASYNC = {\n    'BACKEND': 'path.to.backend',\n}\n\nIf you want to use a different media URL than that specified\nin settings.STATIC_URL, you can add STATIC_URL to the MEDIASYNC\nsettings dict:\nMEDIASYNC = {\n    ...\n    'STATIC_URL': '\/url\/to\/media\/', # becomes http:\/\/yourhost.com\/url\/to\/media\/\n    ...\n}\n\nSame goes for STATIC_ROOT:\nMEDIASYNC = {\n    ...\n    'STATIC_ROOT': '\/path\/to\/media\/',\n    ...\n}\n\nmediasync supports pluggable backends. Please see below for information on\nthe provided backends as well as directions on implementing your own.\n\nMedia expiration\nIf the client supports media expiration, all files are set to expire 365 days\nafter the file was synced. You may override this value by adding\nEXPIRATION_DAYS to the MEDIASYNC settings dict.\n# Expire in 10 years.\nMEDIASYNC['EXPIRATION_DAYS'] = 365 * 10\n\n\nServing media remote (S3\/Cloud Files) or locally\nThe media URL is selected based on the SERVE_REMOTE attribute in the\nMEDIASYNC dict in settings.py. When False, media will be served locally\ninstead of from S3.\n# This would force mediasync to serve all media through the value\n# specified in settings.STATIC_URL.\nMEDIASYNC['SERVE_REMOTE'] = False\n\n# This would serve all media through S3\/Cloud Files.\nMEDIASYNC['SERVE_REMOTE'] = True\n\n# This would serve media locally while in DEBUG mode, and remotely when\n# in production (DEBUG == False).\nMEDIASYNC['SERVE_REMOTE'] = not DEBUG\n\nWhen serving files locally, you can emulate the CSS\/JS combo\/minifying\nbehavior we get from using media processors by specifying the following.\nMEDIASYNC['SERVE_REMOTE'] = False\nMEDIASYNC['EMULATE_COMBO'] = True\n\nNote that this will only work if your STATIC_URL is pointing at your\nDjango dev server. Also keep in mind that some processors may take a while,\nand is best used to check things over before rolling out to production.\n\nDOCTYPE\nlink and script tags are written using XHTML syntax. The rendering can be\noverridden by using the DOCTYPE setting. Allowed values are 'html4',\n'html5', or 'xhtml'. The default in mediasync 2.0 is html5, just as\nthe DOCTYPE on your site should be.\nMEDIASYNC['DOCTYPE'] = 'html5'\n\nFor each doctype, the following tags are rendered:\n\nhtml4\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"...\" type=\"text\/css\" media=\"...\">\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"...\"><\/script>\n\n\nhtml5\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"...\" media=\"...\">\n<script src=\"...\"><\/script>\n\n\nxhtml\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"...\" type=\"text\/css\" media=\"...\" \/>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"...\"><\/script>\n\n\nSSL\nmediasync will attempt to intelligently determine if your media should be\nserved using HTTPS. In order to use automatic SSL detection,\ndjango.core.context_processors.request must be added to\nTEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS in settings.py:\nTEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS = (\n    ...\n    'django.core.context_processors.request',\n    ...\n)\n\nThe USE_SSL mediasync setting can be used to override the SSL\nURL detection.\n# Force HTTPS.\nMEDIASYNC['USE_SSL'] = True\n\nor\n# Force HTTP.\nMEDIASYNC['USE_SSL'] = False\n\nSome backends will be unable to use SSL. In these cases USE_SSL and SSL\ndetection will be ignored.\n\nurls.py\nTo serve local media through mediasync, add a reference to mediasync.urls in\nyour main urls.py file.\nurlpatterns = ('',\n    ...\n    url(r'^', include('mediasync.urls)),\n    ...\n)\n\n\nBackends\nmediasync now supports pluggable backends. A backend is a Python module that\ncontains a Client class that implements a mediasync-provided BaseClient class.\n\nS3\nMEDIASYNC['BACKEND'] = 'mediasync.backends.s3'\n\n\nSettings\nThe following settings are required in the mediasync settings dict:\nMEDIASYNC = {\n    'AWS_KEY': \"s3_key\",\n    'AWS_SECRET': \"s3_secret\",\n    'AWS_BUCKET': \"bucket_name\",\n}\n\nOptionally you may specify a path prefix:\nMEDIASYNC['AWS_PREFIX'] = \"key_prefix\"\n\nAssuming a correct DNS CNAME entry, setting AWS_BUCKET to\nassets.sunlightlabs.com and AWS_PREFIX to myproject\/media would\nsync the media directory to http:\/\/assets.sunlightlabs.com\/myproject\/media\/.\nAmazon allows users to create DNS CNAME entries to map custom domain names\nto an AWS bucket. MEDIASYNC can be configured to use the bucket as the media\nURL by setting AWS_BUCKET_CNAME to True.\nMEDIASYNC['AWS_BUCKET_CNAME'] = True\n\nIf you would prefer to not use gzip compression with the S3 client, it can be\ndisabled:\nMEDIASYNC['AWS_GZIP'] = False\n\n\nTips\nSince files are given a far future expires header, one needs a way to do\n\"cache busting\" when you want the browser to fetch new files before the expire\ndate arrives.  One of the best and easiest ways to accomplish this is to alter\nthe path to the media files with some sort of version string using the key\nprefix setting:\nMEDIASYNC['AWS_PREFIX'] = \"myproject\/media\/v20001201\"\n\nGiven that and the above DNS CNAME example, the media directory URL would end\nup being http:\/\/assets.sunlightlabs.com\/myproject\/media\/v20001201\/.  Whenever\nyou need to update the media files, simply update the key prefix with a new\nversioned string.\nA CACHE_BUSTER settings can be added to the main MEDIASYNC settings\ndict to add a query string parameter to all media URLs. The cache buster can\neither be a value or a callable which is passed the media URL as a parameter.\nMEDIASYNC['CACHE_BUSTER'] = 1234567890\n\nThe above setting will generate a media path similar to:\nhttp:\/\/yourhost.com\/url\/to\/media\/image.png?1234567890\n\nAn important thing to note is that if you're running your Django site in a\nmulti-threaded or multi-node setup, you'll want to be careful about using a\ntime-based cache buster value. Each worker\/thread will probably have a slightly\ndifferent value for datetime.now(), which means your users will find themselves\nhaving cache misses randomly from page to page.\n\nRackspace Cloud Files\nMEDIASYNC['BACKEND'] = 'mediasync.backends.cloudfiles'\n\n\nSettings\nThe following settings are required in the mediasync settings dict:\nMEDIASYNC = {\n    'CLOUDFILES_CONTAINER': 'container_name',\n    'CLOUDFILES_USERNAME': 'cf_username',\n    'CLOUDFILES_API_KEY': 'cf_apikey',\n}\n\n\nTips\nThe Cloud Files backend lacks support for the following features:\n\nsetting HTTP Expires header\nsetting HTTP Cache-Control header\ncontent compression (gzip)\nSSL support\nconditional sync based on file checksum\n\n\nCustom backends\nYou can create a custom backend by creating a Python module containing a Client\nclass. This class must inherit from mediasync.backends.BaseClient. Additionally,\nyou must implement two methods:\ndef remote_media_url(self, with_ssl):\n    ...\n\nremote_media_url returns the full base URL for remote media. This can be\neither a static URL or one generated from mediasync settings:\ndef put(self, filedata, content_type, remote_path, force=False):\n    ...\n\nput is responsible for pushing a file to the backend storage.\n\nfiledata - the contents of the file\ncontent_type - the mime type of the file\nremote_path - the remote path (relative from remote_media_url) to which\nthe file should be written\nforce - if True, write file to remote storage even if it already exists\n\nIf the client supports gzipped content, you will need to override supports_gzip\nto return True:\ndef supports_gzip(self):\n        return True\n\n\nFile Processors\nFile processors allow you to modify the content of a file as it is being\nsynced or served statically.\nMediasync ships with three processor modules:\n\nslim is a minifier written in Python and requires the\nslimmer Python package.

If a file exists with\nthe same css extension, it will be overwritten.\nBy default mediasync uses the sass command with no options. If you would\nlike to specify your own command, specify SASS_COMMAND in settings:\nMEDIASYNC = {\n    ...\n    'SASS_COMMAND': 'sass -scss -l',\n    ...\n}\n\n\nRunning MEDIASYNC\n.\/manage.py syncmedia\n\n\nChange Log\n\n2.2.0\n\nadded pre_sync and post_sync signals\nprovide basic receiver for calling collectstatic before syncing\nprovide receiver for compiling SASS before syncing\nshow media directory listing when serving locally in debug mode\nadd processor for Google's Closure Compiler API for JavaScript\ntemplate tags can now take a variable as the path argument\n\n\n2.1.0\n\ndefault to using STATIC_URL and STATIC_ROOT (Django 1.3), falling back\nto MEDIA_URL and MEDIA_ROOT if the STATIC_* settings are not set\nadd AWS_GZIP setting to optionally disable gzip compression in S3 client\n\nThanks to Rob Hudson and Dolan Antenucci for their contributions to this\nrelease.\n\n2.0.0\n\nupdated Rackspace Cloud Files backend\nuse gzip instead of deflate for compression (better browser support)\nsmart gzip client support detection\nadd pluggable backends\nadd pluggable file processors\nexperimental YUI Compressor\nsettings refactor\nallow override of settings.MEDIA_URL\nImprovements to the logic that decides which files to sync.

You have been warned.\nP.S.: the name is a reference.\nMotivation\nRails makes building RESTful web applications incredibly easy, because\nresource-orientation is baked into the framework\u2014it\u2019s actually harder to make\nyour app unRESTful.\nI wanted to build a similar system for Django; one that made it incredibly\nsimple to model my resources and serve them up with the minimum possible code.\nOne of the most important requirements was powerful yet simple content\nnegotiation: separating application logic from the rendering of responses makes\nwriting an API an effortless task.\nFinally, as strong as Rails\u2019s inspiration was, it still needed to be consistent\nwith the practices and idioms of the Django and Python ecosystems. Dagny doesn\u2019t\nuse any metaclasses (yet), and the code is well-documented and readable by most\nPythonista\u2019s standards.\nAppetizer\nDefine a resource:\nfrom dagny import Resource, action\nfrom django.shortcuts import get_object_or_404, redirect\nfrom polls import forms, models\n\nclass Poll(Resource):\n    \n    @action\n    def index(self):\n        self.polls = models.Poll.objects.all()\n    \n    @action\n    def new(self):\n        self.form = forms.PollForm()\n    \n    @action\n    def create(self):\n        self.form = forms.PollForm(self.request.POST)\n        if self.form.is_valid():\n            self.poll = self.form.save()\n            return redirect(\"Poll#show\", self.poll.id)\n        \n        return self.new.render()\n    \n    @action\n    def edit(self, poll_id):\n        self.poll = get_object_or_404(models.Poll, id=int(poll_id))\n        self.form = forms.PollForm(instance=self.poll)\n    \n    @action\n    def update(self, poll_id):\n        self.poll = get_object_or_404(models.Poll, id=int(poll_id))\n        self.form = forms.PollForm(self.request.POST, instance=self.poll)\n        if self.form.is_valid():\n            self.form.save()\n            return redirect(\"Poll#show\", self.poll.id)\n        \n        return self.edit.render()\n    \n    @action\n    def destroy(self, poll_id):\n        self.poll = get_object_or_404(models.Poll, id=int(poll_id))\n        self.poll.delete()\n        return redirect(\"Poll#index\")\n\nCreate the templates:\n<!-- polls\/index.html -->\n<ol>\n  {% for poll in self.polls %}\n    <li><a href=\"{% url Poll#show poll.id %}\">{{ poll.name }}<\/a><\/li>\n  {% endfor %}\n<\/ol>\n<p><a href=\"{% url Poll#new %}\">Create a poll<\/a><\/p>\n\n<!-- polls\/new.html -->\n<form method=\"post\" action=\"{% url Poll#create %}\">\n  {% csrf_token %}\n  {{ self.form.as_p }}\n  <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Create Poll\" \/>\n<\/form>\n\n<!-- polls\/show.html -->\n<p>Name: {{ self.poll.name }}<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"{% url Poll#edit self.poll.id %}\">Edit this poll<\/a><\/p>\n\n<!-- polls\/edit.html -->\n<form method=\"post\" action=\"{% url Poll#update self.poll.id %}\">\n  {% csrf_token %}\n  {{ self.form.as_p }}\n  <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Update poll\" \/>\n<\/form>\n\nSet up the URLs:\nfrom django.conf.urls.defaults import *\nfrom dagny.urls import resources\n\nurlpatterns = patterns('',\n    (r'^polls\/', resources('polls.resources.Poll', name='Poll')),\n)\n\nDone.\nExample Project\nThere\u2019s a more comprehensive example project which showcases a user\nmanagement app, built in very few lines of code on top of the standard\ndjango.contrib.auth app.\nTo get it running:\ngit clone 'git:\/\/github.com\/zacharyvoase\/dagny.git'\ncd dagny\/\npip install -r REQUIREMENTS  # Installs runtime requirements\npip install -r REQUIREMENTS.test  # Installs testing requirements\ncd example\/\n.\/manage.py syncdb  # Creates db\/development.sqlite3\n.\/manage.py test users  # Runs all the tests\n.\/manage.py runserver\n\nThen just visit http:\/\/localhost:8000\/users\/ to see it in action!\nLicense\nThis is free and unencumbered software released into the public domain.\nAnyone is free to copy, modify, publish, use, compile, sell, or distribute this\nsoftware, either in source code form or as a compiled binary, for any purpose,\ncommercial or non-commercial, and by any means.\nIn jurisdictions that recognize copyright laws, the author or authors of this\nsoftware dedicate any and all copyright interest in the software to the public\ndomain.

It adds a plugin system to the git hooks which allow us to write simple python scripts to run for the different phases in git.\nThere are 3 different actions that can be done with hooked.py.\nTo demonstrate lets create a test git directory:\n$ mkdir \/tmp\/testgit\n$ cd \/tmp\/testgit\n$ git init\n\nNone of the hooks are enabled in a normal git directory:\n$ ls .git\/hooks\/\napplypatch-msg.sample  pre-applypatch.sample      pre-rebase.sample\ncommit-msg.sample      pre-commit.sample      update.sample\npost-update.sample     prepare-commit-msg.sample\n\nIn the hooked directory, we initialize the hooked system for that git repository.\n$ python hooked.py --git-root=\/tmp\/testgit\n\nNow, there is a few additions to the hooks directory:\n$ ls .git\/hooks\/\naction             post-update.sample     prepare-commit-msg\napplypatch-msg.sample  pre-applypatch.sample  prepare-commit-msg.sample\ncommit-msg         pre-commit         pre-rebase.sample\ncommit-msg.sample      pre-commit.sample      update.sample\n\nAt time of writing, hooked.py creates prepare-commit-msg, commit-msg and pre-commit.\nIt also creates the action directory.\n$ ls .git\/hooks\/action\/\nconfig.json  __init__.py  other_hook.py  test_hook.py\n\nBy default, it includes some example hooks but they are disabled. The config.json is a simple json configuration which lists which hooks are installed. By default, none are installed.\n$ cat .git\/hooks\/action\/config.json \n{ \"hooks\": [] }\n\nLets install some hooks, so hooks are stored outside the hooked repository as they are on a per user basis. lets create a git_hooks directory:\n$ mkdir \/tmp\/git_hooks\n$ cd \/tmp\/git_hooks\n\nAnd lets make a python hook to demonstrate:\n$ cat - > new_hook.py\ndef precommit(git_state):\n    for fname in git_state[\"files\"]:\n        if \"action\" in fname:\n            print \"ARGGGGGHHHHHH\"\n            return False\n    return True\n\nThis simply shouts if the word action is in the filename. Lets inject this into our git repo hooks. we can inject a directory or just a file. If you use a directory it will pull out all python files from the directory and all hooks that are copied will be turned on by default.\n$ python hooked.py --git-root=\/tmp\/testgit --inject=\/tmp\/git_hooks\/new_hook.py\n\nNow lets look at the action folder and the contents of config.json:\n$ ls .git\/hooks\/action\/\nconfig.json  __init__.py  new_hook.py  other_hook.py  test_hook.py\n$ cat .git\/hooks\/action\/config.json \n{\"hooks\": [\"new_hook\"]}\n\nYour hooks have now been installed.

Some applications such as CruiseControl can use this to display the results in a user interface.\npython manage.py test --xml\nCode Coverage\nIf you want to know what code is being run when you run your test suite then codecoverage is for you. These two flags use two different third party libraries to calculate coverage statistics. The first dumps the results to stdout, \u2014xmlcoverage creates a cobertura-compatible xml output, and the last one creates a series of files displaying the results.\npython manage.py test --coverage\npython manage.py test --xmlcoverage\npython manage.py test --figleaf\nNo Database\nSometimes your don\u2019t want the overhead of setting up a database during testing, probably because your application just doesn\u2019t use it.\npython manage.py test --nodb\npython manage.py test --nodb --coverage\npython manage.py test --nodb --xmlcoverage\nWARNING Don\u2019t use this if you use the ORM in your app. An outstanding issue means that you can get into trouble.

While webhooks are still at the core, it's becoming a scalable HTTP event engine with HTTP pubsub and long-polling event streaming. And of course, webhooks. Any system with webhooks or looking to implement webhooks will benefit from Hookah.\nRequirements\nHookah currently depends on Twisted.\nUsage\nHookah is a simple, lightweight standalone web server that you run locally alongside your existing web stack. Starting it from the command line is simple:\n    twistd hookah --port 8080\n\nUsing the Dispatcher\nPosting to \/dispatch with a _url POST parameter will queue that POST request for that URL and return immediately. This allows you to use Hookah as an outgoing request queue that handles retries, etc. Using HTTP means you can do this easily from any language using a familiar API.\nPosting to \/dispatch with a _topic POST parameter will broadcast that post to any callbacks subscribed to that topic (see following PubSub section), or any stream consumers with a long-running request on that topic.\nUsing PubSub\nRefer to the PubSubHubbub spec, as Hookah is currently quite compliant with this excellent protocol. The hub endpoint is at \/hub, but this multiplexes (based on 'hub.mode' param) between \/publish for publish pings, and \/subscribe for subscription requests.\nThis feature is still very early and as a result it is incomplete. The main caveat is that there is no permanent storage of subscription data or of the queues. This means if you were to restart Hookah, all subscriptions would have to be made again.\nUsing Streams\nHookah implements a long-running stream API, modeled after Twitter's Stream API. Just do a GET request to \/stream with a topic parameter, and you'll get a persistent, chunked HTTP connection that will send you messages published to that topic as they come in.

To use your own data open censusweb\/config\/settings.py and modify the following line:\nAPI_URL = 'http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/census-test'\n\nSee the next section to learn how to deploy data to your custom S3 bucket.\n\nLoading data\nOnce you've setup the webapp you will have the requirements needed to load data. If you want to load embargoed data you will need to define environment variables for your username and password:\nCENSUS_USER=cgroskopf@tribune.com\nCENSUS_PASS=NotMyRealPassword\n\nYou will also need to have defined your Amazon Web Services credentials so that you can upload the rendered data files to S3:\nexport AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=\"foo\"\nexport AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=\"bar\"\n\nYou will also need to modify the load configuration to point at the same S3 bucket you configured for the webapp. Open dataprocessing\/config.py and modify the following lines:\nS3_BUCKETS = {\n    'staging': 'census-test',\n    'production': 'censusdata.ire.org',\n}\n\nTo load SF1 data for Hawaii make sure you have Mongo running and then execute the following commands:\ncd dataprocessing\n.\/batch_sf.sh Hawaii staging\n\n\nCredits\nThis application was a project of Investigative Reporters and Editors \/ National Institute for Computer-Assisted Reporting.

To override this, we need to change the compiler arguments in the\nfacebook ant.properties:\nvim facebook-android-sdk\/facebook\/ant.properties\n\nReplace the following line:\njava.compilerargs=-Xlint -Werror\n\nWith:\njava.compilerargs=-Xlint\n\nNow you can build the SDK distribution:\ncd socialize-sdk-android\/sdk\nant -Dsdk.dir=\/usr\/local\/android clean build\n\nMake sure you replace \/usr\/local\/android with your local path to the Android SDK\n\nBuilding the Demo App\nTo build and test the demo app from the command line:\ncd socialize-sdk-android\/demo\nant -Dsdk.dir=\/usr\/local\/android clean release\n\nMake sure you replace \/usr\/local\/android with your local path to the Android SDK\nNow you can install the demo app:\n\/usr\/local\/android\/platform-tools\/adb uninstall com.socialize.demo\n\/usr\/local\/android\/platform-tools\/adb install bin\/socialize-demo-release.apk\n\nThe demo app is called, Socialize Demos\n\nBuilding the Documentation\nNote: Sphinx 1.2.2 is required to generate docs:\nsudo pip install sphinx\n\nTo build the html version of the documentation:\ncd socialize-sdk-android\/sdk\nant -Dsdk.dir=\/usr\/local\/android doc\n\nMake sure you replace \/usr\/local\/android with your local path to the Android SDK\nNow you can browse the documentation:\nopen build\/docs\/user_guide\/index.html\n\n\nRunning the Tests\nIn order to run the tests you need either an Android 4.4 device or emulator.  We recommend using the\nGenymotion Android virtualization platform available here: http:\/\/www.genymotion.com\/\nEnsure the device\/emulator is connected and available:\n\/usr\/local\/android\/platform-tools\/adb devices\n\nIf you do not see any devices listed, try restarting the adb server:\n\/usr\/local\/android\/platform-tools\/adb kill-server\n\/usr\/local\/android\/platform-tools\/adb start-server\n\nPrior to running the tests you MUST run an sdk cleanup so that the stage server has its state reset.\nThis is a python script located in the test folder:\ncd socialize-sdk-android\/test\n\npython sdk-cleanup.py <consumer-key> <consumer-secret> \\\n<http:\/\/stage.api.socialize.com\/v1> \\\n[facebook_user_id] [facebook_token]\n\nTo run the tests:\nant -propertyfile ant.global.properties -Dsdk.dir=\/usr\/local\/android test-with-results\n\nMake sure you replace \/usr\/local\/android with your local path to the Android SDK\nNow you can browse the coverage results:\nopen coverage-results\/coverage.html\n\n\nBuilding the Distro\nTo build the distributable SDK (zip):\ncd socialize-sdk-android\/sdk\nant -Dsdk.dir=\/usr\/local\/android clean build\n\nMake sure you replace \/usr\/local\/android with your local path to the Android SDK\n","63":"Presentation\nAn architecture for Android as a replacement of MVC.\nWhy should I use Presentation?\nBecause you want to have more readable, testable code.\nAvoid \"God Objects\", mainly your Activities or Fragments.\nHow does it work?\nSeparation of responsibilities by module:\n\nPresenter: Get a Business Object from the DataProvider and give instructions to the ViewProxy\nDataProvider: Communicate with the \"outside\" to set and get the data, following the instructions of the Presenter\nViewProxy: Convert Presenter instructions and set values to Android Views.\n\nArchitecture\n\nLeak safe.\nDon't hold a strong reference to the DataProvider, Presenter, or ViewProxy.\nSample\nThe goal is to make this application:\n\nEach public method of the modules are defined into an interface:\npublic interface FormDef {\n\n    interface IPresenter extends Base.IPresenter {\n\n        void onClickSaveButton(String value);\n    }\n\n    interface IDataProvider extends Base.IDataProvider {\n\n        String getValueSaved();\n\n        void saveValue(String value);\n    }\n\n    interface IView extends Base.IView {\n\n        void setValueSaved(String text);\n    }\n\n}\n\nThen you have your:\n\nFormPresenter that extends BasePresenter and implements FormDef.IPresenter\nFormDataProvider that extends BaseDataProvider and implements FormDef.IDataProvider\nFormViewProxy that extends BaseViewProxy and implements FormDef.IView\n\nThe easiest way to use this architecture is to override BaseActivity, even if it's NOT mandatory.\npublic class FormActivity extends BaseActivity<FormPresenter, FormViewProxy> {\n\n    @Override\n    public int getContentView() {\n        return R.layout.activity_form;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public Class<FormPresenter> getPresenterClass() {\n        return FormPresenter.class; \/\/ the class of your presenter to be used within this activity\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public FormViewProxy newViewProxy(FormPresenter presenter, Bundle savedInstanceState) {\n        return new FormViewProxy(this); \/\/ the view proxy, with the Activity in param\n    }\n}\n\nNote: it also exists a BaseFragment to do exactly the same but within a Fragment.\nGo further\nRe-use Presenter after Activity destruction\nBecause BasePresenter extends ViewModel (from Android Architecture), it is possible to re-use the same Presenter after a rotation for example.\nWhen you are using BaseActivity, your presenters will be automatically re-used.\nNote: in this case, the DataProvider will also be kept, but you will have to re-create the ViewProxy.\nPresenter into an Adapter\nThis library has a dependency on Efficient Adapter to use the same view cache mechanism.\nThis allows to apply the Presentation pattern to object in an Adapter as well.

Thanks for all OSS people that contributed and\/or provided feedback !!!\n\nRxAssertions is a simple idea for better RxJava assertions.\nI found the original idea from the guys of Ribot : in fact, I think this a good idea and helps to keep tests clean.\nHowever, Ribot guys deprecated their original repo some time ago in favor of vanilla TestSubscriber, so I decided to take my own shot on this.\nThis library mimics and improves the original Ribot`s idea with the following goodies :\n\nAssertJ powered assertions for RxJava (as the original one)\nAll tests rely on BlockingObservable internally\nInternal API rely 100% on TestSubscriber\nImproved public API, covering most of TestSubscriber provided assertions\nImproved Assertions entry points from factory methods, with Observable, BlockingObservable, Single and Completable support\n\nLets see some code diet :\nRegular assertions with TestSubscriber\nTestSubscriber<String> testSubscriber = new TestSubscriber<>();\nObservable.just(\"RxJava\", \"Assertions\").toBlocking().subscribe(testSubscriber);\ntestSubscriber.assertCompleted();\ntestSubscriber.assertNoErrors();\ntestSubscriber.assertValues(\"RxJava\", \"Assertions\");\nAssertions with RxAssertions\nRxAssertions.assertThat(Observable.just(\"RxJava\", \"Assertions\"))\n\t\t.completes()\n\t\t.withoutErrors()\n\t\t.expectedValues(\"RxJava\", \"Assertions\");\nor\nassertThat(Observable.empty())\n\t\t.emitsNothing()\n\t\t.completes()\n\t\t.withoutErrors();\nor\nSingle<String> single = Single.fromCallable(() -> \"RxJava\");\nassertThat(single).completes().expectedSingleValue(\"RxJava\");\nYou can find other examples at test folder\nSetup\nAdd it in your build.gradle\nrepositories {\n\t...\n\tmaven { url \"https:\/\/jitpack.io\" }\n\n}\nAdd the dependency\ndependencies {\n\t...\n\ttestCompile 'com.github.ubiratansoares:rxassertions:$version'\n}\nCheck the releases tab for the latest version.\nRxAssertions uses RxJava 1.1.9 and AssertJ 2.5.0 as dependencies.\nExperimental\nSince v0.3.0, we have some assertions leveraging on AssertJ Conditions API. This kind of assertion offers flexible matching both for emissions and error checks.

That is, the goal is software-software interaction, and as\nsuch, DTrace actions related to controlling output (e.g., printf(),\nprinta()) are not supported.  Error handling is, for the moment, weak.\nPlatforms\nThis should work on any platform that supports DTrace, and is known to work on\nMac OS X (tested on 10.7.5) and illumos (tested on\nSmartOS).\nInstallation\nAs an addon, node-libdtrace is installed in the usual way:\n  % npm install libdtrace\n\nAPI\nnew libdtrace.Consumer()\nCreate a new libdtrace consumer, which will correspond to a new libdtrace\nstate.  If DTrace cannot be initalized for any reason, this will throw an\nexception with the message member set to the more detailed reason from\nlibdtrace.  Note that one particularly common failure mode is attempting to\ninitialize DTrace without the necessary level of privilege; in this case, for\nexample, the message member will be:\n  DTrace requires additional privileges\n\n(The specifics of this particular message should obviously not be\nprogrammatically depended upon.)  If encountering this error, you will\nneed to be a user that has DTrace privileges.\nconsumer.strcompile(str)\nCompile the specified str as a D program.  This is required before\nany call to consumer.go().\nconsumer.go()\nInstruments the system using the specified enabling.  Before consumer.go()\nis called, the specified D program has been compiled but not executed; once\nconsumer.go() is called, no further D compilation is possible.\nconsumer.setopt(option, value)\nSets the specified option (a string) to value (an integer, boolean,\nstring, or string representation of an integer or boolean, as denoted by\nthe option being set).\nconsumer.consume(function func (probe, rec) {})\nConsume any DTrace data traced to the principal buffer since the last call to\nconsumer.consume() (or the call to consumer.go() if consumer.consume()\nhas not been called).  For each trace record, func will be called and\npassed two arguments:\n\n\nprobe is an object that specifies the probe that corresponds to the\ntrace record in terms of the probe tuple: provider, module, function\nand name.\n\n\nrec is an object that has a single member, data, that corresponds to\nthe datum within the trace record.  If the trace record has been entirely\nconsumed, rec will be undefined.\n\n\nIn terms of implementation, a call to consumer.consume() will result in a\ncall to dtrace_status() and a principal buffer switch.  Note that if the\nrate of consumption exceeds the specified switchrate (set via either\n#pragma D option switchrate or consumer.setopt()), this will result in no\nnew data processing.\nconsumer.aggwalk(function func (varid, key, value) {})\nSnapshot and iterate over all aggregation data accumulated since the\nlast call to consumer.aggwalk() (or the call to consumer.go() if\nconsumer.aggwalk() has not been called).  For each aggregate record,\nfunc will be called and passed three arguments:\n\n\nvarid is the identifier of the aggregation variable.  These IDs are\nassigned in program order, starting with 1.\n\n\nkey is an array of keys that, taken with the variable identifier,\nuniquely specifies the aggregation record.\n\n\nvalue is the value of the aggregation record, the meaning of which\ndepends on the aggregating action:\n\n\nFor count(), sum(), max() and min(), the value is the\ninteger value of the aggregation action\n\n\nFor avg(), the value is the numeric value of the aggregating action\n\n\nFor quantize() and lquantize(), the value is an array of 2-tuples\ndenoting ranges and value:  each element consists of a two element array\ndenoting the range (minimum followed by maximum, inclusive) and the\nvalue for that range.\n\n\n\n\nUpon return from consumer.aggwalk(), the aggregation data for the specified\nvariable and key(s) is removed.\nNote that the rate of consumer.aggwalk() actually consumes the aggregation\nbuffer is clamed by the aggrate option; if consumer.aggwalk() is called\nmore frequently than the specified rate, consumer.aggwalk() will not\ninduce any additional data processing.\nconsumer.aggwalk() does not iterate over aggregation data in any guaranteed\norder, and may interleave aggregation variables and\/or keys.\nconsumer.version()\nReturns the version string, as returned from dtrace -V.\nExamples\nHello world\nThe obligatory \"hello world\":\n  var sys = require('sys');\n  var libdtrace = require('libdtrace');\n  var dtp = new libdtrace.Consumer();\n    \n  var prog = 'BEGIN { trace(\"hello world\"); }';\n    \n  dtp.strcompile(prog);\n  dtp.go();\n    \n  dtp.consume(function (probe, rec) {\n          if (rec)\n                  sys.puts(rec.data);\n  });\n\nUsing aggregations\nA slightly more sophisticated example showing system calls aggregated and\nsorted by executable name:\n  var sys = require('sys');\n  var libdtrace = require('libdtrace');\n  var dtp = new libdtrace.Consumer();\n  \n  var prog = 'syscall:::entry { @[execname] = count(); }'\n  \n  dtp.strcompile(prog);\n  dtp.go();\n  \n  var syscalls = {};\n  var keys = [];\n  \n  var pad = function (val, len)\n  {\n          var rval = '', i, str = val + '';\n  \n          for (i = 0; i < Math.abs(len) - str.length; i++)\n                  rval += ' ';\n  \n          rval = len < 0 ? str + rval : rval + str;\n  \n          return (rval);\n  };\n  \n  setInterval(function () {\n          var i;\n  \n          sys.puts(pad('EXECNAME', -40) + pad('COUNT', -10));\n  \n          dtp.aggwalk(function (id, key, val) {\n                  if (!syscalls.hasOwnProperty(key[0]))\n                  \tkeys.push(key[0]);\n  \n                  syscalls[key[0]] = val;\n          });\n  \n          keys.sort();\n  \n          for (i = 0; i < keys.length; i++) {\n                  sys.puts(pad(keys[i], -40) + pad(syscalls[keys[i]], -10));\n                  syscalls[keys[i]] = 0;\n          }\n  \n          sys.puts('');\n  }, 1000);\n\n","74":"<iframe class=\"roundPhoto\" src=\"http:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/20904879?autoplay=1\" width=\"575\" height=\"359\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen><\/iframe>\nKinectCoreVision is a refurnished version of the well know track application CommunityCoreVision to use a KinectSensor.\nThis version of CCV was original designed for a light and portable setup of Communitas multiTouch Table for IEATA\u00b4s 9th International Conference (more info and videos about it).

jQuery Plugin\nTested in all majors browsers:\n\nFirefox\nChrome\nSafari\nInternet Explorer\n\n##License\nnyroModal is licensed under the MIT License.\n##How to use it\nGo to http:\/\/nyromodal.nyrodev.com\/ and download your package.\nYou need to include jQuery on your page.\nThen you can include jquery.nyromodal.custom.js on your page.\nInclude styles\/nyroModal.css. You will also need the images stored in the img folder.\nTo add compabitibilty with IE6, you have to add the following :\n<!--[if IE 6]>\n  <script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"js\/jquery.nyroModal-ie6.js\"><\/script>\n<![endif]-->\n\nThen, add the nyroModal functionnality to your links:\n$('YOUR SELECTOR').nyroModal();\n\nThis will work on many kind of elements, depending of what you included as nyroModal filters (see below)\n##Functions available\nnyroModal comes with a lot of functions that tou could use through your programming.\n###$.fn.nyroModal(opts, fullObj);\nThis is obviously the most useful. It enables the nyroModal functionnality on the element when clicked or submitted for a form.\nYou have to call it to add the bind. The most usual place might be on a ready page event like:\n$(function() {\n  $('.nyroModal').nyroModal();\n});\n\nParameters:\n\nopts: the options parameter might be used in order to change the setting for the specified nyroModal objects\nfullObj: a boolean to indicate if the options parameter is actually a fully nyroModal object\n\n###$.fn.nm(opts, fullObj);\nThis is simply a shortcut for the nyroModal function, they both do exactly the same.\nFor more information, see description above.\n###$.fn.nmInit(opts, fullObj);\nThis function is used in order to initliaze the nyroModal object as data of DOM node.\nThis function will result by create a data('nmObj') on the jQuery object representing the DOM node.\nThis function is used internally, it shouldn't be use in most of case.\nUsage example:\n$(function() {\n  $('.nyroModal').nmInit();\n});\n\nParameters:\n\nopts: the options parameter might be used in order to change the setting for the specified nyroModal objects\nfullObj: a boolean to indicate if the options parameter is actually a fully nyroModal object\n\n###$.fn.nmCall();\nThis function is used to open the nyroModal on a DOM element that already have been initalised with the nyroModal or nm functions.\nUsage example:\n$('#myLink').nmCall();\n\nNote: This code has exaclty the same effect than triggering a nyroModal event like:\n$('#myLink').trigger('nyroModal');\n\n###$.nmManual(url, opts);\nThis function is used to manually open a nyroModal by giving only an url.\nTo use it, the Link Filter is required.\nExample usage:\n$.nmManual('page.html');\n\nParameters:\n\nurl: The url to open. it might a DOM selector or anything else\nopts: the options parameter might be used in order to change the setting for the specified nyroModal objects\n\n###$.nmData(data, opts);\nThis function is used to manually open a nyroModal by giving it's content.\nTo use it, the Link Filter and the Data Filter are required.\nExample usage:\n$.nmData('my content<br \/>is so greaaaaaaaaaaaat !');\n\nParameters:\n\ndata: The data to be shown inside the modal\nopts: the options parameter might be used in order to change the setting for the specified nyroModal objects\n\n###$.nmObj(opts);\nThis is used to overwrite the default function or settings of the nyroModal object created when initialising a nyroModal Object.\nThis could be used to change the default animations to use or change the default behavior of the nyroModal.\nExemple usage:\n$(function() {\n  $.nmObj({anim: {def: 'fade'}});\n});\n\n###$.nmInternal(opts);\nThis is used to overwrite internal object of nyroModal used in many places in the code.\nThis could be used to change the default behavior of nyroModal.\nExemple usage in jquery.nyroModal-ie6 in order to calculate the size according to this browser:\n$.nmInternal({\n  _calculateFullSize: function() {\n\tvar scrollHeight = Math.max(\n\t  document.documentElement.scrollHeight,\n\t  document.body.scrollHeight\n\t),\n\toffsetHeight = Math.max(\n\t  document.documentElement.offsetHeight,\n\t  document.body.offsetHeight\n\t),\n\tscrollWidth = Math.max(\n\t  document.documentElement.scrollWidth,\n\t  document.body.scrollWidth\n\t),\n\toffsetWidth = Math.max(\n\t  document.documentElement.offsetWidth,\n\t  document.body.offsetWidth\n\t);\n\tthis.fullSize = {\n\t  wW: $w.width(),\n\t  wH: $w.height()\n\t};\n\tthis.fullSize.h = scrollHeight < offsetHeight ? $w.height() : scrollHeight;\n\tthis.fullSize.w = scrollWidth < offsetWidth ? $w.width() : scrollWidth;\n\tthis.fullSize.viewW = Math.min(this.fullSize.w, this.fullSize.wW);\n\tthis.fullSize.viewH = Math.min(this.fullSize.h, this.fullSize.wH);\n  }\n});\n\n###$.nmAnims(opts);\nThis is used to add or overwrite animations pack.\nSee js\/jquery.nyroModal.anims.fade.js to see how the code looks like.\nSee animations section below to learn how it should be written an used.\n###$.nmFilters(opts);\nThis is used to add or overwrite filters pack.\nThis might be the most useful part of nyroModal as it allow devleopper to create a totally new behavior on it's own, without breaking all others.\nSee filters section below to learn how it should be written and used.\n###$.nmTop();\nAs nyroModal allow multiple nyroModal to be opened at the same time, this function return the nyroModal Object of the last opened modal, ie the modal at the top.\nIf nothing is open, undefined will be returned.\n##Selectors\nnyroModal defines 3 selectors that could be used transparently in your code like any others jQuery selectors.\n###:nyroModal\nThis selector retrieves all elements that was binded using the nyroModal() function.\nFor instance, if you want to open all modal at the same time (not recommended), you can do:\n$(':nyroModal').nmCall();\n\n###:nm\nThis is an alias for the previous selector, :nyroModal.\nthey both do exactly the same.\n###:nmOpen\nThis selector retrieves all modals that are curently opened.\nThis could be useful to close them all at the same time:\n$(':nmOpen').each(function() {\n  $(this).data('nmObj').close();\n}):\n\nnyroModal Object\nDescription of what is, how and when to use it.\nList of all of settings and functions\n##Filters\nFilters are used to provide many basics functionnality like Ajax download, but it alos let you the ability to fully customize the way nyroModal work, by adding as many callbacks as you need.\nA filter is a set function that will be called by nyroModal core at many differents points. These functions call be used to do everything needed to make the modal work as you excpet or to add others behaviors needed for your projet: add some elements inside the modal, updating your page content, add some Ajax call, etc...\nHere is how filters works:\n\n\nWhen $('element').nyroModal(); is called, the nyroModal object is created and attached to the DOM element instancied\n\n\nEvery available filters are tested again the nyroModal object using the is function\n\nIf this function returns true, the filters will be used all the time for this element.\nIf it returns false, the filters will not be used anymore for this element.\n\n\n\nnyroModal core calls every init function of every filters selected for the element\n\nThese init function should bind the event they need, create their own object if needed.\nIf the filters need to be the one used to load the content, the loadFilter setting of the nyroModal ovject should be defined to its name.\n\n\n\nThrougout the living of nyroModal, every function or callback defined in all selected filters will be called (see the list below)\n\n\nAll function or callbacks receive the same nyroModal object as a unique parameter.\nThe list of all function or callback that can be called in a filter:\n\nis: should return true or false to select the filter for the current or element or not. This function is REQUIRED !\ninitFilters: called just after every filters have been determined to use or not, and just before the init of them. Good place to force filters.\ninit: called at the very beggining of the process. This function should bind element or create object needed later\ninitElts: called at the beggining of the open process, juste before the load start. After that, all the needed div are created and attached to the DOM\nload: called only for ONE filter defined in nm.loadFilter attribute. This function should load the function and set it's content using the _setCont function\nfilledContent: called once the content is placed on the hidden div\nerror: called in case of error (URL not founr for example)\nsize: called after the size has been defined\nclose: called at the end of the closing process, regarding only the data (useful for gallery)\nbeforeClose: called at the beggining of the closing process, regarding the animation\nafterClose: called at the end of the closing process, regarding the animation\nkeyHandle: called when a key is hit if the keyHandle is enable and if the modal is on the top\n\nLike the version 1, there is a bunch of others callback that you can define before and after every animation. The version 2 put it in a new way by letting you the ability to define a function before and after every animation function.\n\nbeforeShowBg: called just before the showBg animation\nafterShowBg: called just after the showBg animation\nbeforeHideBg: called just before the hideBg animation\nafterHideBg: called just after the hideBg animation\nbeforeShowLoad: called just before the showLoad animation\nafterShowLoad: called just after the showLoad animation\nbeforeHideLoad: called just before the hideLoad animation\nafterHideLoad: called just after the hideLoad animation\nbeforeShowCont: called just before the showCont animation (also called in case of a transition, before beforeHideTrans)\nafterShowCont: called just after the showCont animation (also called in case of a transition, after afterHideTrans)\nafterReposition: called just after the .nmRepositon have been placed\nafterUnreposition: called just after the .nmRepositon have been replaced on their initial positions\nbeforeHideCont: called just before the hideCont animation\nafterHideCont: called just after the hideCont animation\nbeforeShowTrans: called just before the showTrans animation (transition)\nafterShowTrans: called just after the showTrans animation (transition)\nbeforeHideTrans: called just before the hideTrans animation (transition)\nafterHideTrans: called just after the hideTrans animation (transition)\nbeforeResize: called just before the resize animation\nafterresize: called just after the resize animation\n\nnyroModal automatically add 2 filters for every elements:\n\nbasic: used to provide basic functionnality. This filter shouldn't be modified unless you know exactly what you're doing\ncustom: This filter has absolutely no programming. It's added here juste to provide a quick way to add your filters callback\n\nThere is some some basic filters that you can use on your project that enable the basic usage of this kind of plugin.\nHere is a list of the filters officially provided:\n\nTitle: Show the title for the modal using the title attribute of the opener element\nGallery: Enable arrows and navigation keys trough the element with the same rel attribute defined in the DOM (depends on title)\nLink: Bind an anchor element and load the target using Ajax to retrieve content\nDom: Instead of using Ajax, it get the content within the page using an id. (exemple link : ) (depends on link)\nImage: Show an image, and resize it if needed (depends on link)\nSWF: Show a SWf animation (depends on link)\nForm: Bind a form and load the target by sending it's data trhough Ajax\nForm file: Same as Form but used when form should send file\nIframe: Used to show data from an other domain name or when target=\"_blank\" is present (depends on link)\nIframe form: Used to open a form in an iframe (depends iframe)\nEmbedly: Used to show a bunch of different element using embedly API (Examples) (depends on link) Embedly requires developers to sign up for an API key at embedly Pricing\n\n##Animations\n##Debug\nIn order to enable the debug mode, you should change the debug value of the internal object. You can do it like:\n$.nmInternal({debug: true});\n\nBy default, the debug function show function name in the console. If you want do something else, you should overwrite the _debug function like:\n$.nmInternal({\n  _debug: function(msg) {\n\tif (this.debug && window.console && window.console.log)\n\t  window.console.log(msg);\n  }\n});\n\n##Help\nYou can find some useful tips on the issues labeled with tips\nIf it's still not enought, be free to open an Issue on github.\n","81":"\nOther Options\nMaxArt2501 has started his own Object.observe polyfill, and a look at his commit history and reasoning makes me think it will probably be well supported.  If your looking for an Object.observe solution you should take a look at https:\/\/github.com\/MaxArt2501\/object-observe\nNeeds a maintainer\nI'd like to find someone who is willing to take this library over.  I've had no time to work with and\/or maintain the library.  Honestly I have little need for Object.observe making it hard to justify time spent against it.\nSo, if your using this shim, feel comfortable with the code, and would like to maintain it, let me know.\nIf your curious why I don't have much use for the library, this http:\/\/markdalgleish.github.io\/presentation-a-state-of-change-object-observe\/ pretty well sums it up.  I worked in native development when two way data binding caused all sorts of issues with application development, and I see the same coming out of Object.observe at the end of the day.\nHopefully, someone will want to maintain this work in the future.\nOh, and if you take it over, feel free to relicense it within reason as it seems no one likes unlicense :).  Also feel free to follow up on the polyfill-service integration if you so see fit (https:\/\/github.com\/Financial-Times\/polyfill-service\/pull\/81#issuecomment-66382432).\nObject.observe Polyfill\/shim\nThanks to my new job I have a lot more time to devote to things like this library.  It has gone a REALLY long time without updates and there is a lot that can be done to make it more functional.  I hope to be spending more time on it soon, but for now I've fixed all the bugs that I know of and have been reported.  Thanks to everyone for their reports, and keep them coming if you find one.\nStarted as GIST: https:\/\/gist.github.com\/4173299\nTested against Chromium build with Object.observe and acts EXACTLY the same for the basics, though Chromium build is MUCH faster.\nTrying to stay as close to the spec as possible, this is a work in progress, feel free to comment\/update\nhttp:\/\/wiki.ecmascript.org\/doku.php?id=harmony:observe\nTODO\nThe spec has changed a lot since I origionally wrote this, need to go back and add in a lot of things like custom update types and other fun.  For now though it seems to suffice.\nLimits so far\nBuilt using polling in combination with getter&setters.  This means that if you do something quick enough it won't get caught.\nExample:\nvar myObject = {};\nObject.observe(myObject, console.log);\nmyObject.foo = \"bar\";\ndelete myObject.foo;\nThe observer function would never see the addition of foo since it was deleted so quickly.\nTesting\nTo run the tests first make sure you have Node.js installed.  Then use NPM to install Karam and all dependencies:\nnpm install\n\nFinally run the tests with:\nnpm test\n\nPlanned Updates\nFor FireFox using Proxies will result in better performance.  Will look into this more.\nExamples and Usage\nSee examples folder\nLatest Updates\n* Memory leak fixed with PR #16\n* Tests added to project thanks to mikeb1rd also part of PR #16\n* Added Notifier.notify() with custom types support by klimlee\n* Added accept list support by klimlee\n* Stopped monitoring DOM nodes, Canary can't do it and neither should the shim.\n* Added in support for setImmediate if it is available.\n* Memory leak fix by Moshemal\n* Array length now reports as an update when it changes\n* Added enumerable flag to defineProperty\n\n","82":"TransformJS 1.0 Beta\n2D and 3D transforms as regular CSS properties you can set using .css() and animate using .animate()\nOverview\nCSS Transforms  were first introduced in WebKit in 2007, and have now\nreached mass-adoption by all the major browser vendors.

The AlphaBeta component is, in fact, just a special type of React component that \"wraps\" the component variants you're testing.\nlightweight: The AlphaBeta package is small and the AlphaBeta component is thin, so AlphaBeta tests won't measurably increase the time it takes for your application to render. Since AlphaBeta is so lightweight, you can be less selective about what you choose to test - it may even make sense to run single-variant tests, wrapping components you may test in the future in an AlphaBeta component today in order to establish a baseline for comparison.\nbackend agnostic: Since split testing requires that you store event data, AlphaBeta needs to communicate with a datastore in order to work. But AlphaBeta will work with whatever datastore you're currently using - just follow the instructions in Backend \/ API Setup to build your endpoint, point AlphaBeta to it, and you're good to go.\nextensible: AlphaBeta is designed to make it easy for developers to integrate basic split tests into their React apps without having to think about the underlying statistics. But it's also possible to build your own custom logic around how confidence intervals are calculated and how user cohorting works within your app.\n\nBuilding your first A\/B test is simple:\nimport { ABComponent } from 'react-alpha-beta';\n\nclass ButtonA extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    return (<Button onClick={this.props.successAction}\n                    style={{'background-color':'blue'}}>\n              \"Sign Up\"\n            <\/Button>);\n  }\n}\n\nclass ButtonB extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    return (<Button onClick={this.props.successAction}\n                    style={{'background-color':'orange'}}>\n              \"Sign Up\"\n            <\/Button>);\n  }\n}\n\nclass Page extends React.Component {\n    render() {\n        return (\n            <div>\n                <ABComponent\n                    ComponentA={ButtonA}\n                    ComponentB={ButtonB}\n                    experimentParams={{\n                      id: '1',\n                      testCohortSize: 0.4,\n                    }}\n                \/>\n            <\/div>\n        );\n    }\n}\n\nReactDOM.render(\n    <Page \/>,\n    document.getElementById('app')\n);\nYour experiment results will look something like this:\n{\n  meanDifferenceValue: -0.05023923444976075,\n  marginOfError: 0.04837299277280508,\n  statisticalSignificance: true,\n  details: \"Our best estimate is that the absolute rate of success is 5% lower with variant B, and this result is statistically significant (We are 95% confident the true difference is between -10% and 0%.). Given this information, you should probably stick with variant A.\",\n}\nInstallation\n$ npm install react-alpha-beta --save\nOverview and Basic Usage\nThe AlphaBeta component is a React component that \"wraps\" two other components. These two \"wrapped\" components are passed as ComponentA and ComponentB, and they represent the two variants you're testing. Each user that encounters the AlphaBeta component will see one of the two variants, and the AlphaBeta component will report back to your server (i) which variant was displayed and (ii) if a success event occurred.\nIn addition to your ComponentA and ComponentB variants, you'll also pass experimentParams to each of your AlphaBeta components. experimentParams is an object containing the keys id and testCohortSize.\nid is the unique id of a particular experiment, and is passed by the AlphaBeta component to your Backend \/ API (described below). Each AlphaBeta component that you declare should have a unique id associated with it.\ntestCohortSize is a number between 0.0 and 1.0. Its value tells your AlphaBeta component what proportion of your users will see each experiment variant. A testCohortSize value of 0.01 means that 1% of your users should see the ComponentB variant - the other 99% should see ComponentA. A value of .5 indicates that there should be an even split between the two variants.\nWhen you wrap your variants in an AlphaBeta component, the AlphaBeta component passes the prop successAction to each of them.\nYou get to decide what constitutes \"success\" in the context of your experiment. If you're testing a button variation, \"success\" might be defined as a click (this is the case in the above code sample). If you're testing a landing page variation, \"success\" might be defined as submitting a validated form.\nNote that while you have the ability to define \"success\" however you want, it is also your responsibility to make sure that successAction is fired by each of your variants when \"success\" occurs. Otherwise, AlphaBeta will have no way of giving you guidance about which variant is more likely to produce the desired outcome.\nThe Button example is designed to help you get comfortable using the AlphaBeta component. You'll need to set up your Backend \/ API for the example to work (instructions below), but reading through the example may help you better understand how to use AlphaBeta, even prior to fully setting things up.\nBackend \/ API Setup\nWait, AlphaBeta Needs a Backend?\nIn order for AlphaBeta to be useful, it needs to be able to record data about the experiments you're running. In other words, it needs to be linked to a datastore of some type. This reliance on a datastore isn't unique to AlphaBeta - it is true of split testing in general.\nImagine that you're running an experiment to see if changing a particular button from a transparent background (variant A) to a solid blue background (variant B) leads to more clicks. (If you already looked at the Button example, this should look familiar...)\nTo measure which variant performs better, you need to keep track of each variant's \"impressions\" (how many users have seen each button) and \"conversions\" (how many times each button is clicked).\nWhen we are able to keep track of these values, all it takes is a bit of math to estimate (within a specific range or \"confidence interval\") which button leads to more conversions. AlphaBeta handles this math for you, but you're responsible for logging the events themselves in your datastore.\nSo How Do I Set Up My AlphaBeta Endpoint?\nYou can connect AlphaBeta to a datastore you're already using in two steps.\nStep 1:\nSet up an API endpoint for AlphaBeta to Consume\nAlphaBeta expects to be able to interact with an endpoint at www.yoursite.com\/api\/alphabeta\/{{experimentId}}\/, where {{experimentId}} is the unique id you pass to each AlphaBeta component in experimentParams.\nAlphaBeta will both POST to and GET from this endpoint. When AlphaBeta detects an \"impression\" or a \"conversion\", it will POST to this endpoint, so all users who may encounter an experiment should be able to POST to this endpoint.\nYou can safely restrict GET requests to only allow access to users who should be able to see data about your experiments.\nIt's also a good idea (though not strictly necessary) to set up your endpoint such that GET requests made without an {{experimentId}} return a list of your experiments. This is a good idea if you wish to build a single page where you can view data about all of our experiments.\nEnsure Your Endpoint Accepts POST Requests Correctly\nWhen AlphaBeta POST data to your endpoint, the POST body should look like this:\n{\n    variant: \"a\",             \/\/ this will either be \"a\" or \"b\"\n    success: null,            \/\/ this will either be null or true\n    userCohortValue: .10392,  \/\/ a number between 0 and 1\n    metaId: null,             \/\/ this will be null unless you choose to set it\n}\n\n\nvariant tells your datastore which component variant (A or B) was presented to a particular user.\n\n\nsuccess tells your datastore whether the success event occurred (true) or not (null).\n(Note that the value for this parameter will either be true or null, as opposed to true or false. When success is passed as null, that signals that an impression has occurred. It is passed as null because when the component is loaded we don't know if the user will trigger the success event or not. When success is passed as true, that signals that a success event has occurred.)\n\n\nuserCohortValue is a number between 0.0 and 1.0 that AlphaBeta has associated with the particular user in this experiment. This number is randomly generated the first time a user encounters a particular AlphaBeta experiment, and is core to how AlphaBeta separates users into cohorts.\n\n\nmetaId is a value that you can optionally pass to your AlphaBeta component. It should be used in cases where the component that you're testing occurs more than one time times on your site.\n\n\nHere is an example of when you would set the metaId attribute:\nImagine you instead were testing the copy on a Facebook-style \"like\" button to see if changing \"like\" to \"+1\" led to more engagement. Each piece of content a user views in his\/her news feed should have a \"like\" (or \"+1) button below it. But since each user has multiple items in his\/her feed, a single user could \"like\" more than one piece of content.\nIn this case, you could set a metaId that uniquely identifies the piece of content being \"liked\". If you were to set the metaId, you would be testing which variant leads to more total likes per unit of content seen. If you were to not set the metaId, you would be testing which variant is more likely to lead to a user liking at least one piece of content.\nEnsure Your Endpoint Responds to GET Requests Correctly\nWhen AlphaBeta GETs data from your endpoint, the returned data should look like this\n{\n  variantA: {\n    trialCount:   291,  \/\/ the number of unique impressions for this variant\n    successCount: 59,   \/\/ the number of unique success events for this variant\n  },\n  variantB: {\n    trialCount:   101,\n    successCount: 22,\n  },\n  confidenceInterval: .95 \/\/ the CI you're looking to achieve, expressed as a float\n}\nStep 2:\nEnsure Your Back End Processes POST Requests Correctly\nWhen POST data is received, one of three things is supposed to happen:\n1 - the trialCount for an experiment variant could be incremented by 1.\n2 - the successCount for an experiment could be incremented by 1.\n3 - Nothing at all.\nThe logic for what should happen must be executed by your application's backend. Here's how things should work:\n\n\nif success === null and no previous trial exists where both userCohortValue and metaId are equal to this trial's values, you should increment trialCount by one for the appropriate variant.\n\n\nif success === true and no previous trial exists where both userCohortValue and metaId are equal to this trial's values and success === true, you should increment successCount by one for the appropriate variant.\n\n\nin all other cases, you should not take any action.\n\n\nChecking Your Experiment Results\nimport { getExperimentData } from 'react-alpha-beta';\n\nconsole.log(getExperimentData(experimentId));\nTo view your experiment results, call the getExperimentData function with the experimentId for a particular experiment. It will return a json object with the keys meanDifferenceValue, marginOfError, statisticalSignificance, and details.\n\nmeanDifferenceValue is AlphaBeta's best estimate (or mean estimate) of ComponentB's performance relative to ComponentA. A positive number indicates that ComponentB is leading to more successActions per impression than ComponentA, while a negative number indicates the opposite.\n\nNote that meanDifferenceValue alone doesn't mean much if the experiment hasn't yet reached statistical significance.\n\n\nmarginOfError is the margin of error (or uncertainty) that exists in the experiment.\n\n\nstatisticalSignificance, a boolean, represents whether this experiment has yet reached statistical significance at the level of confidence you defined.\n\n\ndetails is a human readable description of this experiment's current results.\n\n\nSample result from getExperimentData:\n{\n  meanDifferenceValue: -0.05023923444976075,\n  marginOfError: 0.04837299277280508,\n  statisticalSignificance: true,\n  details: \"Our best estimate is that the absolute rate of success is 5% lower with variant B, and this result is statistically significant (We are 95% confident the true difference is between -10% and 0%.). Given this information, you should probably stick with variant A.\",\n}\n\nExample\nNote: in order for this example to work, you must first set up an API endpoint for AlphaBeta to consume. If you haven't done this yet, follow the steps in Backend \/ API Setup\n\nButton example: Set up an experiment to see which of two button variants has a greater click-through rate. This example covers (i) basic experiment setup, (ii) the two ways to pass your variant components to the AlphaBeta component, and (iii) basic usage of the AlphaBeta DevTools.\n\nAlphaBeta DevTools\nAlphaBeta comes with a DevTools component that can be used on any page containing an experiment.\nimport { ABComponent, DevTools } from 'react-alpha-beta';\n\n\/\/ ***\n\/\/ Build your experiment component, which we'll call <Page \/> here.\n\/\/ Make sure that <DevTools \/> is in your <Page \/> component.\n\/\/ ***\n\nReactDOM.render(\n    <Page \/>,\n    document.getElementById('app')\n);\nOne easy way to familiarize yourself with the DevTools component is to load the Button example.\nIf the DevTools component is included on your page and you are not in a production environment (i.e. process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production'), you should see a DevTools box in the lower right hand corner of your screen. This box lets you control your user cohort value for each of the experiments on the page. Recall that the user cohort value for an experiment, along with the testCohortSize parameter, determine which variant a user sees.\nIf the user cohort value is greater than or equal to testCohortSize, the user will see variant A for this experiment. If the user cohort value is less than testCohortSize, the user will see variant B. When you manipulate the DevTools sliders, you are changing your user cohort value for an experiment. These changes will take place when you refresh the page.\nYou can add the DevTools component to the lower level components that contain your experiments, or to higher level components of your application.\nDiscussion and Support\nJoin our Slack team!\nAdditional Resources\n\nA\/B testing course (Udacity)\nHypothesis testing with one sample (Khan Academy)\n\nLint\n$ npm run lint\nTest\n$ npm run test        # run once\n$ npm run test:watch  # continuous testing as file changes\n$ npm run test:cov    # generate test coverage report\nContribute\nWe are using commitizen to make commit format consistent.\n# Install the command line tool.\n$ npm install -g commitizen\n\n# From then on, whenever you would like to commit:\n$ git add .\n$ git cz\n# ... follow the prompt messages\nLicense\nMIT\nCredits\n\nJack McCloy\nBrian Park\nBen Hall\n\n","86":"Famous Examples\n##DEPRECATED: please find our examples inside of our main repo\nLicense\nAll the code in the src\/examples folder is licensed under the MIT license.

If you like, you can place this code right below your admin.autodiscover()\nbits:\n# urls.py\nimport oembed\noembed.autodiscover()\n\n\nConsuming Resources\nNow you're ready to start consuming OEmbed-able objects.  There are a couple of\noptions depending on what you want to do.  The most straightforward way to get\nup-and-running is to add it to your templates:\n{% load oembed_tags %}\n\n{% oembed %}blog.content{% endoembed %}\n\n{# or use the filter #}\n\n{{ blog.content|oembed }}\n\n{# maybe you're working with some dimensional constraints #}\n\n{% oembed \"600x600\" %}blog.content{% endoembed %}\n\n{{ blog.content|oembed:\"600x600\" }}\n\nYou can consume oembed objects in python as well:\nimport oembed\noembed.autodiscover()\n\n# just get the metadata\nresource = oembed.site.embed('http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=nda_OSWeyn8')\nresource.get_data()\n\n{u'author_name': u'botmib',\n u'author_url': u'http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/botmib',\n u'height': 313,\n u'html': u'<object width=\"384\" height=\"313\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/v\/nda_OSWeyn8&fs=1\"><\/param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"><\/param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"><\/param><embed src=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/v\/nda_OSWeyn8&fs=1\" type=\"application\/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"384\" height=\"313\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"><\/embed><\/object>',\n u'provider_name': u'YouTube',\n u'provider_url': u'http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/',\n u'title': u'Leprechaun in Mobile, Alabama',\n u'type': u'video',\n u'version': u'1.0',\n u'width': 384}\n\n# get the metadata and run it through a template for pretty presentation\nfrom oembed.consumer import OEmbedConsumer\nclient = OEmbedConsumer()\nembedded = client.parse_text(\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=nda_OSWeyn8\")\n\n<div class=\"oembed oembed-video provider-youtube\">\n  <object width=\"384\" height=\"313\">\n    <param name=\"movie\" value=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/v\/nda_OSWeyn8&fs=1\"><\/param>\n    <param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"><\/param>\n    <param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"><\/param>\n    <embed src=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/v\/nda_OSWeyn8&fs=1\"\n           type=\"application\/x-shockwave-flash\"\n           width=\"384\"\n           height=\"313\"\n           allowscriptaccess=\"always\"\n           allowfullscreen=\"true\">\n    <\/embed>\n  <\/object>\n  <p class=\"credit\">\n    <a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=nda_OSWeyn8\">Leprechaun in Mobile, Alabama<\/a>\n    by\n    <a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/botmib\">botmib<\/a>\n  <\/p>\n<\/div>'\n\n\nTroubleshooting\nProblem: You try the youtube embed example, but all you get is a link to the youtube video.\nSolution: Djangoembed uses fixtures to load data about oembed providors like Youtube in to the database.  Try fooling around with syncdb (or migrations, if you're running South) until there are objects of type oembed.storedprovider.\nIf you have another problem, consider looking through the more extensive docs in the project's doc subdirectory.\n","93":"ZeroDB server and client-side example of using it\nDocumentation: http:\/\/docs.zerodb.io\/\n","94":"crontabber\nA cron job runner with self-healing and job dependencies.\nLicense: MPL 2\n\n\n\nHow to run tests\nFirst you need to create a dedicated test database.

Let us know if you'd like to step in!\n\n\n\nA bird's eye view\nSea Cucumber is a mail backend for Django. Instead of sending emails\nthrough a traditional SMTP mail server, Sea Cucumber routes email through\nAmazon Web Services' excellent Simple Email Service (SES) via django-celery.\n\nWhy Sea Cucumber\/SES instead of SMTP?\nConfiguring, maintaining, and dealing with some complicated edge cases can be\ntime-consuming. Sending emails with Sea Cucumber might be attractive to you if:\n\nYou don't want to maintain mail servers.\nYour mail server is slow or unreliable, blocking your views from rendering.\nYou need to send a high volume of email.\nYou don't want to have to worry about PTR records, Reverse DNS, email\nwhitelist\/blacklist services.\nYou are already deployed on EC2 (In-bound traffic to SES is free from EC2\ninstances). This is not a big deal either way, but is an additional perk if\nyou happen to be on AWS.\n\n\nInstallation\nAssuming you've got Django and django-celery installed, you'll need\nBoto 2.0b4 or higher. boto is a Python library that wraps the AWS API.\nYou can do the following to install boto 2.0b4 (we're using --upgrade here to\nmake sure you get 2.0b4):\npip install --upgrade boto\n\nInstall Sea Cucumber:\npip install seacucumber\n\nAdd the following to your settings.py:\nEMAIL_BACKEND = 'seacucumber.backend.SESBackend'\n\n# These are optional -- if they're set as environment variables they won't\n# need to be set here as well\nAWS_SES_REGION_NAME = 'YOUR-REGION'  # Default is us-east-1\nAWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = 'YOUR-ACCESS-KEY-ID'\nAWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = 'YOUR-SECRET-ACCESS-KEY'\n\n# Make sure to do this if you want the ``ses_address`` management command.\nINSTALLED_APPS = (\n    ...\n    'seacucumber'\n)\n\nThe region name is optional but keep in mind addresses are linked to a specific region, therefore if you add\/verify them in one region they will only be available in that region.\n\nEmail Address Verification\nBefore you can send email 'from' an email address through SES, you must first\nverify your ownership of it:\n.\/manage.py ses_address verify batman@gotham.gov\n\nAfter you've run the verification above you will need to check the email\naccount's inbox (from your mail client or provider's web interface) and click\nthe authorization link in the email Amazon sends you. After that, your address\nis ready to go.\nTo confirm the verified email is ready to go:\n.\/manage.py ses_address list\n\nTo remove a previously verified address:\n.\/manage.py ses_address delete batman@gotham.gov\n\nNow, when you use django.core.mail.send_mail from a verified email address,\nSea Cucumber will handle message delivery.\n\nRate Limiting\nIf you are a new SES user, your default quota will be 1,000 emails per 24\nhour period at a maximum rate of one email per second. Sea Cucumber defaults\nto enforcing the one email per second at the celery level, but you must not\nhave disabled celery rate limiting.\nIf you have this:\nCELERY_DISABLE_RATE_LIMITS = True\n\nChange it to this:\nCELERY_DISABLE_RATE_LIMITS = False\n\nThen check your SES max rate by running:\n.\/manage.py ses_usage\n\nIf your rate limit is more than 1.0\/sec, you'll need to set that numeric\nvalue in your CUCUMBER_RATE_LIMIT setting like so:\n# Rate limit to three outgoing SES emails a second.\nCUCUMBER_RATE_LIMIT = 3\n\nFailure to follow the rate limits may result in BotoServerError exceptions\nbeing raised, which makes celery unhappy.\nAs a general note, your quota and max send rate will increase with usage, so\ncheck the ses_usage management command again at a later date after you've\nsent some emails. You'll need to manually bump up your rate settings in\nsettings.py.\n\nRouting Tasks\nIf you want to route Sea Cucumber task to different queues.\nAdd this to setting:\nCUCUMBER_ROUTE_QUEUE = 'YOUR-ROUTE-QUEUE'\n\nThen update the celery configuration for routes. Example celeryconfig.py:\nCELERY_ROUTES = {\n    'seacucumber.tasks.#': {'queue': 'YOUR-ROUTE-QUEUE'},\n}\n\n\nDKIM\nUsing DomainKeys is entirely optional, however it is recommended by Amazon for\nauthenticating your email address and improving delivery success rate.  See\nhttp:\/\/docs.amazonwebservices.com\/ses\/latest\/DeveloperGuide\/DKIM.html.\nBesides authentication, you might also want to consider using DKIM in order to\nremove the via email-bounces.amazonses.com message shown to gmail users -\nsee http:\/\/support.google.com\/mail\/bin\/answer.py?hl=en&answer=1311182.\nTo enable DKIM signing you should install the pydkim package and specify values\nfor the DKIM_PRIVATE_KEY and DKIM_DOMAIN settings.  You can generate a\nprivate key with a command such as openssl genrsa 1024 and get the public key\nportion with openssl rsa -pubout <private.key.  The public key should be\npublished to ses._domainkey.example.com if your domain is example.com.  You\ncan use a different name instead of ses by changing the DKIM_SELECTOR\nsetting.\nThe SES relay will modify email headers such as Date and Message-Id so by\ndefault only the From, To, Cc, Subject headers are signed, not the full\nset of headers.  This is sufficient for most DKIM validators but can be overridden\nwith the DKIM_HEADERS setting.\nExample settings.py:\nDKIM_DOMAIN = 'example.com'\nDKIM_PRIVATE_KEY = '''\n-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\nxxxxxxxxxxx\n-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n'''\n\nExample DNS record published to Route53 with boto:\n\nroute53 add_record ZONEID ses._domainkey.example.com. TXT '\"v=DKIM1; p=xxx\"' 86400\n\nDjango Builtin-in Error Emails\nIf you'd like Django's Builtin Email Error Reporting to function properly\n(actually send working emails), you'll have to explicitly set the\nSERVER_EMAIL setting to one of your SES-verified addresses. Otherwise, your\nerror emails will all fail and you'll be blissfully unaware of a problem.\nNote: You can use the included ses_address management command to handle\naddress verification.\n\nGetting Help\nIf you have any questions, feel free to either post them to our\nissue tracker.\n","99":"\nNOTICE: Deprecated\nThis project is deprecated and no longer actively maintained by Disqus.

The only important part that needs to be taken into consideration is what is done with the values, whether that is storing them for later, showing them to the user in the UI, or just changing application behaviour.\nRead on to find out more details about how StoreBox can be used and how it can be added to an Android project.\nAdding to a project\nStoreBox can be used in Android projects using minimum SDK version 10 and newer (Android 2.3+).\nJAR\nv1.4.0 JAR\nv1.4.0 JavaDoc JAR\nGradle\ncompile 'net.orange-box.storebox:storebox-lib:1.4.0'\n\nMaven\n<dependency>\n  <groupId>net.orange-box.storebox<\/groupId>\n  <artifactId>storebox-lib<\/artifactId>\n  <version>1.4.0<\/version>\n<\/dependency>\n\nDefining an interface and bringing it to life\nSimply create a new interface class in your IDE or a text editor, give it an access modifier which suits its use, and name it as appropriate.\npublic interface MyPreferences {\n    \n}\nNow you're ready to use StoreBox.create() to obtain an instance.\nMyPreferences instance = StoreBox.create(context, MyPreferences.class);\nAdding get and set methods\nIf you would like to add a getter just add a method to the interface which returns a value and make sure to annotate it using @KeyByString or @KeyByResource.\n@KeyByString(\"key_nickname\")\nString getNickname();\n\n@KeyByResource(R.string.key_notifications)\nboolean shouldShowNotifications();\nAdding a setter is just as easy.

A type adapter implementation can be provided by extending from one of the following classes:\n\nBaseBooleanTypeAdapter for storing as a Boolean\nBaseFloatTypeAdapter for storing as a Float and so on...\nBaseIntegerTypeAdapter\nBaseLongTypeAdapter\nBaseStringTypeAdapter\nBaseStringSetTypeAdapter (only supported on API11 and newer)\n\nTelling StoreBox which type adapter should be used can be done by adding the @TypeAdapter annotation to the get and set methods.\n@KeyByString(\"key_region\")\n@TypeAdapter(RegionTypeAdapter.class)\nRegion getRegion();\n\n@KeyByString(\"key_region\")\n@TypeAdapter(RegionTypeAdapter.class)\nvoid setRegion(Region value);\nWhich type adapter needs to be extended depends on the use case. Take a look at the DateTypeAdapter, UriTypeAdapter, and CustomClassListTypeAdapter for some examples. It is worth noting that in the last example Gson is being used for serialising the type, as opposed to writing a custom implementation. Gson is not used internally by StoreBox, as such if you wish to use Gson for a type adapter you will need to add it to your project as a dependency.\nThe following types will work out of the box, so type adapters don't need to be provided for them:\n\nDate\nDouble\nEnum\nUri\n\nDisclaimer: APIs around type adapters may change in the future, as I will keep looking for a less verbose way of achieving the same goal without requiring the use of Gson.\nOpening different types of preferences\nIn all of the examples so far details about what preferences are opened and how have been omitted.\nWithout any annotation the default shared preferences will be used, but the @DefaultSharedPreferences annotation can be added to the interface definition for explicitness. Likewise, @ActivityPreferences or @FilePreferences can be used to respectively open preferences private to an activity or to open preferences using a file name.\nThe mode with which the preferences should be opened can also be specified, although this option is not supported by all the types.\n@ActivityPreferences(mode = PreferencesMode.MULTI_PROCESS)\npublic interface WelcomeActivityPreferences {\n    \n    \/\/ method definitions here...\n}\nAdvanced\nRemove and clear methods\nIn order to remove a value stored in the preferences under a key a method to perform the removal can be annotated with the @RemoveMethod annotation. The key can be supplied in two ways;\nThe key can be provided thorough an argument in the method, using either a String or an int in the case of the key being specified in an XML resource.\npublic interface RemoveMethodExample {\n    \n    @RemoveMethod\n    void remove(String key);\n    \n    @RemoveMethod\n    void remove(int keyRes);\n}\n\n\/\/ usage\npreferences.remove(\"key_username\");\npreferences.remove(R.string.key_password);\nOr a value-specific remove method can be defined with the help of the @KeyByString or @KeyByResource annotations.\npublic interface RemoveMethodExample {\n    \n    @KeyByString(\"key_username\")\n    @RemoveMethod\n    void removeUsername();\n    \n    @KeyByResource(R.string.key_password)\n    @RemoveMethod\n    void removePassword();\n}\n\n\/\/ usage\npreferences.removeUsername();\npreferences.removePassword();\nClearing all values stored in the preferences can be done by annotating a method with the @ClearMethod annotation.\npublic interface ClearMethodExample {\n    \n    @ClearMethod\n    void clear();\n}\n\n\/\/ usage\npreferences.clear();\nChange listeners\nCallbacks can be received when a preference value changes through the use of the OnPreferenceValueChangedListener interface. The listeners need to be parametrised with the type which is used for the value whose changes we would like to listen for. For example, if we would like to listen to changes to the password (from previous examples) then we could define the listener as\nOnPreferenceValueChangedListener<String> listener = new OnPreferenceValueChangedListener<String>() {\n    @Override\n    public void onChanged(String newValue) {\n        \/\/ do something with newValue\n    }\n}\nTo register this listener a method for registering the listener would need to be defined using the @RegisterChangeListenerMethod annotation in the interface which gets passed to StoreBox.create(). Likewise, for unregistering a listener the method needs to be annotated with @UnregisterChangeListenerMethod instead. The @KeyByString or @KeyByResource annotation also needs to be used to specify which value we are interested in.\npublic interface ChangeListenerExample {\n    \n    @KeyByString(\"key_password\")\n    @RegisterChangeListenerMethod\n    void registerPasswordListener(OnPreferenceValueChangedListener<String> listener);\n    \n    @KeyByString(\"key_password\")\n    @UnregisterChangeListenerMethod\n    void unregisterPasswordListener(OnPreferenceValueChangedListener<String> listener);\n}\nIf you would like to listen for changes to a custom type then the @TypeAdapter annotation will need to be added to the method in order to tell StoreBox how the value should be adapted when retrieving it from the preferences.\nMore than one listener can be registered and unregistered at a time by changing the method definitions in the interface to use variable arguments.\n\/\/ annotations omitted\nvoid registerPasswordListeners(OnPreferenceValueChangedListener<String>... listeners);\nCaution: StoreBox does not store strong references to the listeners. A strong reference must be kept to the listener for as long as the listener will be required, otherwise it will be susceptible to garbage collection.\nChaining calls\nWith Android's SharedPreferences.Editor class it is possible to keep chaining put methods as each returns back the SharedPreferences.Editor instance. StoreBox allows the same functionality. All that needs to be done is to change the set\/remove method definitions to either return interface type itself or SharedPreferences.Editor.\npublic interface ChainingExample {\n    \n    @KeyByString(\"key_username\")\n    ChainingExample setUsername(String value);\n    \n    @KeyByString(\"key_password\")\n    ChainingExample setPassword(String value);\n    \n    @KeyByString(\"key_country\")\n    ChainingExample removeCountry();\n}\nAnd calls can be chained as\npreferences.setUsername(\"Joe\").setPassword(\"jOe\").removeCountry();\nForwarding calls\nIf you would like to access methods from the SharedPreferences or SharedPreferences.Editor, you can do that by extending your interface from either of the above (or even both).\npublic interface ForwardingExample extends SharedPreferences, SharedPreferences.Editor {\n    \n    \/\/ method definitions here\n}\nAnd the methods from either of the extended interfaces will be callable.\nString username = preferences.getString(\"key_username\", \"\");\npreferences.putString(\"key_username\", \"Joe\").apply();\nSave modes\nChanges to preferences can normally be saved on Android either through apply() or commit(). Which method gets used can be customised in StoreBox through the use of the @SaveOption annotation.\nUnlike any of the previous annotations @SaveOption can be used to annotate both the interface as well as individual set\/remove methods, however an annotation at method-level will take precedence over an interface annotation.\n@SaveOption(SaveMode.APPLY)\npublic interface SaveModeExample {\n    \/\/ key annotations omitted\n    \n    void setUsername(String value); \/\/ will save using apply()\n    \n    @SaveOption(SaveMode.COMMIT)\n    void setPassword(String value); \/\/ will save using commit()\n    \n    @SaveOption(SaveMode.COMMIT)\n    void removeUsername(); \/\/ will persist using commit()\n}\nVersioning\nStoreBox supports versioning of preferences through the use of the @PreferencesVersion interface-level annotation, in a similar fashion to Android's SQLiteOpenHelper. This functionality may be required in the case when the schema of the preferences needs to be changed, such as when a key or type of a preference changes, an enum constant is added\/renamed\/removed, or a class which is being stored in the preferences changes internally. The @PreferencesVersion annotation needs to be added to the interface which will be used with StoreBox.create().\nBy default, without the @PreferencesVersion annotation, the version used is assumed to be 0. The first time a change is required the version for the annotation should be set to 1, with the value being incremented for any subsequent changes. To provide the logic for handling version upgrades a handler class extending from PreferencesVersionHandler needs to be specified.\n@PreferencesVersion(version = 1, handler = MyPreferencesVersionHandler.class)\npublic interface MyPreferences {\n    \n    \/\/ method definitions here\n}\n\npublic class MyPreferencesVersionHandler extends PreferencesVersionHandler {\n    \n    @Override\n    protected void onUpgrade(\n            SharedPreferences prefs,\n            SharedPreferences.Editor editor,\n            int oldVersion,\n            int newVersion) {\n        \n        \/\/ logic for handling upgrades\n    }\n}\nFor an initial upgrade from 0 to 1 the onUpgrade method will be called with oldVersion = 0 and newVersion = 1. If the version of the preferences would be updated to 2, then the handler would be called with oldVersion = 1 and newVersion = 2. If however an application update using version 1 was skipped, then onUpgrade would be called with oldVersion = 0 and newVersion = 2, which means that handling the intermediate upgrade between versions 1 and 2 would be required. Calling apply() or commit() on the editor is not required after changes are made, as StoreBox will take care of this when saving the new version value into the preferences. Take a look here for an example of how upgrades could be handled.\nThe versions are also independent of each other, and apply only to specific preference files. For example, you could have a shared preferences with version X, activity A preferences with version Y, and activity B preferences with version Z. Or none at all, if versioning is not needed.\nObtaining a more customised instance at run-time\nAs previously described you can build an instance of your interface using StoreBox.create(), however if you'd like to override at run-time any annotations you can use StoreBox.Builder and apply different options.\nMyPreferences preferences =\n        new StoreBox.Builder(context, MyPreferences.class)\n        .preferencesMode(PreferencesMode.MULTI_PROCESS)\n        .build()\nDefaults\nGiven the minimum amount of details provided to the interface and method definitions through the use of StoreBox's annotations, the following defaults will get used:\n\nPreferences type: Default shared preferences\nPreferences mode: Private\nSave mode: Apply\nDefault value mode: Empty\n\nProguard\nIf you are using ProGuard add the following lines to your configuration.\n-dontwarn net.jodah.typetools.TypeResolver\n-keep class net.orange_box.storebox.** { *; }\n-keepattributes *Annotation*,Exceptions,InnerClasses,Signature\n\n\nContributing\nAny contributions thorough pull requests as well as raised issues (bugs are rated just as highly as features!) will be welcome and highly appreciated.\nIf you would like to submit a pull request please make sure to do so against the develop branch, and please follow a similar code style to the one used in the existing code base. Running the tests before and after any changes is highly recommended, just as is adding new test cases.\nContributors\n\ncr5315\n\nLicense\nCopyright 2015 Martin Bella\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n    http:\/\/www.apache.org\/licenses\/LICENSE-2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.\n\n","103":"StoreBox\nAndroid library for streamlining SharedPreferences.\n\n\n \n\nContents\n\nOverview\nAdding to a project\nInterface and creation\nGet and set methods\nDefaults for get methods\nCustom types\nPreference types\nAdvanced\nRemove and clear methods\nChange listeners\nChaining calls\nForwarding calls\nSave modes\nVersioning\nBuilder & Defaults\nProGuard\nContributing\nLicense\n\nOverview\nStoreBox is an annotation-based library for interacting with Android's SharedPreferences, with the aim take out the the how and where parts of retrieving\/storing values and instead focus on the more important what part.\nNormally when retrieving or storing values we need to know two pieces of information during each call: the key and the type.\nString username = preferences.getString(\"key_username\", null);\npreferences.edit().putString(\"key_date_of_birth\", \"30\/09\/2004\").apply(); \/\/ should this be a String or a long?\nWith StoreBox the operations above can be changed into pre-defined methods with improved semantics.\n\/\/ definition\npublic interface MyPreferences {\n    \n    @KeyByString(\"key_username\")\n    String getUsername();\n    \n    @KeyByString(\"key_date_of_birth\")\n    void setDateOfBirth(String value);\n}\n\n\/\/ usage\nMyPreferences preferences = StoreBox.create(context, MyPreferences.class);\nString username = preferences.getUsername();\npreferences.setDateOfBirth(\"30\/09\/2004\");\nThe caller now doesn't need to worry about the key, neither about what type the values are stored under.

To provide the logic for handling version upgrades a handler class extending from PreferencesVersionHandler needs to be specified.\n@PreferencesVersion(version = 1, handler = MyPreferencesVersionHandler.class)\npublic interface MyPreferences {\n    \n    \/\/ method definitions here\n}\n\npublic class MyPreferencesVersionHandler extends PreferencesVersionHandler {\n    \n    @Override\n    protected void onUpgrade(\n            SharedPreferences prefs,\n            SharedPreferences.Editor editor,\n            int oldVersion,\n            int newVersion) {\n        \n        \/\/ logic for handling upgrades\n    }\n}\nFor an initial upgrade from 0 to 1 the onUpgrade method will be called with oldVersion = 0 and newVersion = 1. If the version of the preferences would be updated to 2, then the handler would be called with oldVersion = 1 and newVersion = 2. If however an application update using version 1 was skipped, then onUpgrade would be called with oldVersion = 0 and newVersion = 2, which means that handling the intermediate upgrade between versions 1 and 2 would be required. Calling apply() or commit() on the editor is not required after changes are made, as StoreBox will take care of this when saving the new version value into the preferences. Take a look here for an example of how upgrades could be handled.\nThe versions are also independent of each other, and apply only to specific preference files. For example, you could have a shared preferences with version X, activity A preferences with version Y, and activity B preferences with version Z. Or none at all, if versioning is not needed.\nObtaining a more customised instance at run-time\nAs previously described you can build an instance of your interface using StoreBox.create(), however if you'd like to override at run-time any annotations you can use StoreBox.Builder and apply different options.\nMyPreferences preferences =\n        new StoreBox.Builder(context, MyPreferences.class)\n        .preferencesMode(PreferencesMode.MULTI_PROCESS)\n        .build()\nDefaults\nGiven the minimum amount of details provided to the interface and method definitions through the use of StoreBox's annotations, the following defaults will get used:\n\nPreferences type: Default shared preferences\nPreferences mode: Private\nSave mode: Apply\nDefault value mode: Empty\n\nProguard\nIf you are using ProGuard add the following lines to your configuration.\n-dontwarn net.jodah.typetools.TypeResolver\n-keep class net.orange_box.storebox.** { *; }\n-keepattributes *Annotation*,Exceptions,InnerClasses,Signature\n\n\nContributing\nAny contributions thorough pull requests as well as raised issues (bugs are rated just as highly as features!) will be welcome and highly appreciated.\nIf you would like to submit a pull request please make sure to do so against the develop branch, and please follow a similar code style to the one used in the existing code base.

This means any reference to a collection is effectively immutable. However, modifications can be made by returning a new version of the data structure, leaving the original structure unchanged.\nHere's an example using Dexx's Sets (examples are in Kotlin for conciseness, but the collections are pure Java):\nval set1 = Sets.of(1, 2, 3)\nval set2 = set1.add(4)\nval set3 = set1.remove(1)\nprintln(set1) \/\/ Prints Set(1, 2, 3)\nprintln(set2) \/\/ Prints Set(1, 2, 3, 4)\nprintln(set3) \/\/ Prints Set(2, 3)\nFrom the above example we can see that although we've made modifications to set1 to create set2 and set3, the contents of set1 remain unchanged.\nNote: There's now first class support for Kotlin - see the kollection module README for more information.\nWhy port?\nScala's collections can be directly used from Java, but the resulting code is far from idiomatic. Scala's standard library is also large and binary incompatible between versions.\nSecondly, a pure Java implementation of functional persistent collections is usable from not only Java, but other JVM languages that interoperate with Java such as Kotlin, Ceylon or GWT. In fact, the collections have been specifically designed for use with Kotlin.\nOverview\nThe diagram below shows Dexx's class hierarchy (interfaces are in blue and concrete implementations are in green).\n\nNote that the interfaces such as Map, Set and List are not related to the java.util equivalents as persistent collections require all modification methods such as add and remove to return a new collection instance.\nStatus\n\nAll collections have been implemented\nHashSet, TreeSet, HashMap, TreeMap and Vector are ports from Scala\nConsList and ArrayList have been written from scratch.\nHelper classes for construction and adapters to java.util collections are available\nTest coverage is fairly comprehensive: 95% line and 90% branch at present\n\nDependencies\n\nThere are no runtime dependencies\nJetBrain's annotations (@NotNull and @Nullable) are used in the source to support Kotlin's nullable types, but they are not required at runtime.\nThe tests are written in Kotlin, but again this is not a runtime dependency\n\nRoadmap\n\nExplore annotating methods that return a new collection with @CheckReturnValue\nto allow static verification of collection usage.\nActive development is essentially complete. Further work is expected to be bug fixes and refinements.\n\nRelease Notes\n\n0.7:\n\nFixes #11 - a balancing error in red black trees\n\n\n0.6:\n\nAdded OSGI metadata (thanks ajs6f)\nMake internal fields final (thanks mkull)\nPerformance improvement to first and last of TreeMap & TreeSet (thanks mkull)\n\n\n0.5:\n\nUpdated to 1.0.0\nAdded toImmutableMap() conversions from existing Maps\n\n\n0.4:\n\nUpdated to 1.0.0-rc-1036\nRemoved accidental assertJ compile dependency in kollection (thanks @brianegan)\n\n\n0.3.1:\n\nAdded a native Kotlin api in the kollection module\nConverted the build to gradle from maven\nRenamed dexx-collections artifact to collection\n\n\n0.2:\n\nAdd LinkedLists support with ConsList as the default implementation\nAdd ArrayList as an alternative IndexedList implementation\nFormalise the Builder contract and enforce at runtime\n\n\n0.1:\n\nIncludes ports of Scala's HashSet, TreeSet, HashMap, TreeMap and Vector\n\n\n\nLicense\nThis project is licensed under a MIT license. Portions ported from Scala are Scala's 3-clause BSD license.\nUsage\nAdding to your project\nVersion 0.7 has been released and is available in Maven Central here. You can use it via the following gradle dependency:\n'com.github.andrewoma.dexx:collection:0.7' \/\/ For Java\n'com.github.andrewoma.dexx:kollection:0.7' \/\/ For Kotlin\nConstructing collections\nEach of the leaf interfaces (Set, SortedSet, Map, SortedMap, IndexedList and LinkedList) have\nassociated companion classes with static methods for construction.\nThe companion class uses the plural form of the interface. e.g. Set has a companion class of Sets.\nTo build a collection from a fixed number of elements, use the overloaded of() methods. e.g.\nval set = Sets.of(1, 2, 3)\nTo build a collection from a java.util collection, use the copyOf() methods. e.g.\nval set = Sets.copyOf(javaCollection)\nBuilders should be used when incrementally constructing a collection. This allows for more efficient structures\nto be used internally during construction. In the case of LinkedList, using a builder is important as LinkedList does not support appending without copying the entire collection.\nval builder = Sets.builder<Int>()\nfor (i in 1..100) {\n    builder.add(i)\n}\nval set = builder.build()\nViewing as java.util collections\nUnfortunately, the java.util collection interfaces are not compatible with persistent collections as\nmodifications such as add() must return a new collection instance, leaving the original untouched.\nHowever, all collections can be viewed as an immutable form of their java.util equivalent by using the\nthe as...() methods.\nval javaSet = Sets.of(1, 2, 3).asSet() \/\/ Now a java.util.Set\nWhere are filter(), map() and friends?\nSuch transformations are deliberately not supported:\n\n\nIn JDK versions < 1.8, using a functional style is ugly and not recommended.\nSee Excessive use of Guava's functional programming idioms can lead to verbose, confusing, unreadable, and inefficient code.\n\n\nIn Kotlin and JDK 1.8, the platform provides transformations that can be used on the collections for free.\nAdding another set of transformations directly to the collections (with subtly different semantics) seems harmful.\n\n\nHere's an example of using lazy evaluation in a functional style with Kotlin:\nval set = SortedSets.of(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6).asSequence()\n        .filter { it % 2 == 0 }\n        .map { \"$it is even\" }\n        .take(2)\n        .toImmutableSet()\n\nassertEquals(SortedSets.of(\"2 is even\", \"4 is even\"), set)\nThe example above uses Kotlins in-built extension function that converts any Iterable into a Sequence.\nIt also uses the following extension functions to add Sequence<T>.toImmutableSet() to cleanly convert the sequence\nback into a Dexx Collection.\nfun <T, R> Sequence<T>.build(builder: Builder<T, R>): R {\n    this.forEach { builder.add(it) }\n    return builder.build()\n}\n\nfun <T> Sequence<T>.toImmutableSet(): SortedSet<T> = build(SortedSets.builder<T>())\nPerformance\nBenchmarking is still a work in progress (all the warnings about JVM benchmarks apply). The results so far\nrunning on Mac OS X 10.11.1 x86_64 with JDK 1.8.0_65 (Oracle Corporation 25.65-b01) are here.\nMy conclusions so far are that the collections perform adequately to be used as a drop-in replacement\nfor the majority of use cases. While slower, slow is generally referring to millions of operations per second.\nIn general, mutating methods incur a overhead of 2-5 times that of java.util equivalents and\nreading operations are 1-1.5 time slower.\n@ptitjes Has done some more rigorous benchmarks here: https:\/\/github.com\/ptitjes\/benchmark-immutables\/blob\/master\/results\/2016-10-02-23:56:36.pdf\nDevelopment\n\nDexx is built with gradle. Use .\/gradlew install to build and install into your local repository.\nTo run the benchmarks, use .\/gradlew check -PdexxTestMode=BENCHMARK --info | grep '^    BENCHMARK:'.\nTo generate coverage reports, use:\n\n.\/gradlew :collection:clean :collection:check :collection:jacocoTestReport\n open collection\/build\/jacocoHtml\/index.html\n\n\nBy default, a quick version of tests are run. Getting better test coverage of Vectors requires large\ncollections. To run tests with complete coverage use: .\/gradlew -PdexxTestMode=COMPLETE :collection:clean :collection:check :collection:jacocoTestReport\n\nMethod counts\nFor android developers, here are method

This project is the Java\/Spring based\nbackend, a stateless REST API with either OAuth2 or basic authentication.\nYou can read all about trackr in our developer blog:\n\nArchitecture and Backend\nTesting\nMail Approvals with Spring Integration\nFrontend\nFile Downloads with AngularJS\nProcesses and Tools\n\nFor the API documentation just go here.\nThere is also a Vagrant project building the whole application over here.\nHow to start\nIf you just want to mess around with the API a bit the default configuration is very sensible and has no external dependencies (well, except Java).\nIf you have gradle, just run\ngradle run\n\nIf you don't have gradle and want to use the wrapper run\n.\/gradlew run\n# or\ngradlew.bat run\n\nIf you want to start from your IDE, i.e. for debugging open the class Trackr and start the main method.\nTo verify it works you can use curl. The users don't have a password in this configuration, so just press enter when curl asks for one. If you don't like the usernames\nchange them in import.sql.\ncurl --user moritz.schulze@techdev.de localhost:8080\n\nThe default config uses port 8080, if that is used on your system you can add\nserver:\n    port: $port\n\nto the top of the application.yaml and choose a port that you want for $port.\nProfiles\ntrackr has a lot of Spring profiles to add\/switch features.\n\n\n\nprofile\ndescription\nnotes\n\n\n\n\nin-memory-database\nuses a H2 database, creates the schema with hibernate\nexcluse with real-database\n\n\nreal-database\nuses a configurable database, executes flyway\nexclusive with in-memory-database\n\n\nhttp-basic\nprotects the API with HTTP basic authentication\nexclusive with oauth\n\n\noauth\nprotects the API as a OAuth2 resource server\nexclusive with http-basic. Database for OAuth2 tokens needed.\n\n\ngranular-security\nroles and per endpoint security\n\n\n\ngmail\nsends mail with Gmail and enables mail receiving\nwhen off, does not receive mails and uses a logging mail sender.\n\n\ndev\ninitialize the database with data.sql\n\n\n\nprod\nJust some different settings for our production env\n\n\n\n\nTake a look in the application.yaml to see what properties these profiles need.\nThe default profiles are in-memory-database,dev,granular-security,http-basic. If you want to use other profiles, there are several possible ways.\n\nYou can change the spring.profiles.active value in application.yaml\nIf you use gradle run you can prepend (example) SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=dev,gmail,real-database. You can also use this to overwrite e.g. the port with SERVER_PORT=8000.\nIf you run from your IDE, you can add --spring.profiles.active=dev,gmail,real-database as program arguments to the run configuration.\n\nPlease refer to the Spring Boot Reference for more information.\nThe oauth profile\nThe oauth profile marks the trackr backend as a OAuth2 resource server, that means access is only possible with a valid access token issued by an authorization server. We use a\nJDBC token store, so valid tokens need to be put there. Please take a look at our (soon to be open sourced) techdev portal to see how we do this.\nThe granular-security profile\nWhen this is not selected, to access the API the user needs to be authenticated. With granular security the access to some endpoints depend on the role of the user or even the\nid of the user. In trackr, the id of a user is the email address of the belonging employee.\nWhen the oauth profile is switched off, all users have the role ROLE_ADMIN. When oauth is on, the roles must be stored in the access token.\nTake a look at the @PreAuthorize and @PostAuthorize annotations in the code to see what this will activate.\nHow to build\nJust run\ngradle build\n\n(or use the wrapper if you don't have gradle installed). The JAR file will be in build\/libs and can just be run with java -jar. The application.yaml file has to be in the\nworking directory where the java command was issued.\n","109":"RetroDagger\nAndroid project using MVP + Dagger2 + Retrofit.\nThis code was created to support this article: https:\/\/medium.com\/@franpulido\/retrofit-dagger-mvp-305ac2cf646c\n","110":"Mephisto\n\nDependencies\nAll Platforms\nReSwitched unicorn fork:\ngit clone git@github.com:reswitched\/unicorn.git\ncd unicorn\nUNICORN_ARCHS=\"aarch64\" .\/make.sh\nsudo .\/make.sh install\n\nPython packages:\npip install -r requirements.txt\n\nUbuntu\nInstall Clang 5 from the LLVM PPA: http:\/\/apt.llvm.org\/\nYou may need to update libc++ as well, if you get tuple errors.\nOSX\nInstall llvm (will take a while)\nbrew install llvm --HEAD\n\nPatch Makefile\ndiff --git a\/Makefile b\/Makefile\nindex e4c921b..4d53420 100644\n--- a\/Makefile\n+++ b\/Makefile\n@@ -1,4 +1,4 @@\n-CC := clang++-4.0\n+CC := clang++\nRunning\nMuch like the original CageTheUnicorn, the default use of Mephisto is via the load files.

It's a backpropagation neural net simulator,\nwith features that make it easy to think of your input data as either\none-dimensional or two-dimensional. You specify a network topology in\na text file (topology.txt). The input data to the neural is specified\nin a text file (inputData.txt). The inputData.txt file can contain the\nactual input values for all the input samples, or it can contain a list\nof .bmp or .dat files that contain the input data in binary form.\nNeural2d is for educational purposes. It's not production-quality code,\nand it's not burdened with a lot of bling. It's just heavily-commented\nneural net code that you can take apart and see how it works. Or modify\nit and experiment with new ideas. Or extract the functions you need and\nembed them into your own project.\nIf you're not using the optional GUI interface, then neural2d has no\ndependencies other than a conforming C++11 compiler. If using the GUI\ninterface, you'll need to link with a standard POSIX sockets networking\nlibrary.\nRequirements\n\nC++-11 compiler\n\ne.g., g++ 4.7 on Linux or Cygwin, Visual Studio 2013 on Windows\n\n\nPOSIX sockets (only needed if compiling the optional GUI)\n\ne.g., Cygwin on Windows\n\n\nCMake 2.8.12 or later\nCompiles and runs on Linux, Windows, and probably Mac\n\nCompiling the source\nWe use CMake to configure the build system. First get the source code\nfrom the Gitub repository. If using the command line, the command is:\n git clone https:\/\/github.com\/davidrmiller\/neural2d\n\nThat will put the source code tree into a directory named neural2d.\nCompiling with CMake graphical interface\nIf you are using the CMake graphical interface, run it and set the\n\"source\" directory to the neural2d top directory, and set the binary\noutput directory to a build directory under that (you must create the\nbuild directory), then click Configure and Generate. Uncheck WEBSERVER\nif you don't want to compile the optional GUI. Here is what it looks like:\n\nCompiling with CMake command line interface\nIf you are using CMake from the command line, cd to the neural2d top\nlevel directory, make a build directory, then run cmake from there:\ngit clone https:\/\/github.com\/davidrmiller\/neural2d\ncd neural2d\nmkdir build\ncd build\ncmake ..\nmake\n\nThere is no \"install\" step. After the neural2d program is compiled,\nyou can execute it or open the project file from the build directory.\nOn Windows, by default CMake generates a Microsoft Visual Studio project\nfile in the build directory. On Linux and Cygwin, CMake generates\na Makefile that you can use to compile neural2d. You can specify a\ndifferent CMake generator with the -G option, for example:\n cmake -G \"Visual Studio 14 2015\" ..\n\nTo get a list of available CMake generators:\n cmake --help\n\nIf you get errors when compiling the integrated webserver, you can\nbuild neural2d without webserver support by running CMake with the\n-DWEBSERVER=OFF option, like this:\n cmake -DWEBSERVER=OFF ..\n\nHow to run the digits demo\nOn systems using Makefiles, in the build directory, execute:\nmake test\n\nThis will do several things: it will compile the\nneural2d program if necessary; it will expand the\narchive named image\/digits\/digits.zip into 5000 individual\nimages;\nand it will then train the neural net to classify those digit images.\nThe input data, or \"training set,\" consists of images of numeric\ndigits. The first 50 look like these:\n\nThe images are 32x32 pixels each, stored in .bmp format. In this demo,\nthe neural net is configured to have 32x32 input neurons, and 10 output\nneurons. The net is trained to classify the digits in the images and\nto indicate the answer by driving the corresponding output neuron to a\nhigh level.\nOnce the net is sufficiently trained, all the connection weights are\nsaved in a file named \"weights.txt\".\nIf you are not using Makefiles, you will need to expand the archive in\nimages\/digits, then invoke the neural2d program like this:\n neural2d ..\/images\/digits\/topology.txt ..\/images\/digits\/inputData.txt weights.txt\n\nHow to run the XOR example\nOn systems using Makefiles, in the build directory, execute:\n make test-xor\n\nFor more information about the XOR example, see\nthis wiki page.\nGUI interface (optional)\nFirst, launch the neural2d console program in a command window with the -p option:\n .\/neural2d topology.txt inputData.txt weights.txt -p\n\nThe -p option causes the neural2d program to wait for a command before\nstarting the training. The screen will look something like this:\n\nAt this point, the neural2d console program is paused and waiting for\na command to continue. Using any web browser, open:\n http:\/\/localhost:24080\n\nA GUI interface will appear that looks like:\n\nPress Resume to start the neural net training. It will automatically\npause when the average error rate falls below a certain threshold (or\nwhen you press Pause). You now have a trained net. You can press Save\nWeights to save the weights for later use.\nSee the neural2d wiki for\ndesign notes on the web interface.\nVisualizations\nAt the bottom of the GUI window, a drop-down box shows the visualization\noptions that are available for your network topology, as shown\nbelow. There will be options to display the activation (the outputs)\nof any 2D layer of neurons 3x3 or larger, and convolution kernels of\nsize 3x3 or larger. Visualization images appear at the bottom of the\nGUI. You can mouse-over the images to zoom in.\n\nHow to use your own data\nInput data to the neural net can be specified in text or binary format. If\nyou want to specify input values in text format, just list the input\nvalues in the inputData.txt file. If you're inputting from .bmp or .dat\nbinary files, then list those filenames in inputData.txt. Details are\nexplained below.\nText input format\nTo specify input data as text, prepare a text file, typically called\ninputData.txt, with one input sample per line. The input values go inside\ncurly braces. If the data is for training, the target output values must\nbe specified on the same line after the input values. In each sample, the\ninput values are given in a linear list, regardless whether the neural\nnet input layer is one-dimensional or two-dimensional. For example, if\nyour neural net has 9 input neurons of any arrangement and two output\nneurons, then the inputData.txt file for training will look like this\nformat:\n{ 0.32 0.98 0.12 0.44 0.98 0.22 0.34 0.72 0.84 } -1  1   \n{ 1.00 0.43 0.19 0.83 0.97 0.87 0.75 0.47 0.92 }  1  1   \n{ 0.87 0.75 0.47 0.92 1.00 0.43 0.19 0.83 0.97 } -1 -1   \n{ 0.34 0.83 0.97 0.87 0.75 0.43 0.19 0.47 0.92 } -1  1   \netc.. . .  \n\nBinary input formats\nThere are two binary options -- .bmp image files, and .dat data\nfiles. First, prepare your .bmp or .dat files, one sample per file. If\nusing .bmp files, the number of pixels in each image should equal the\nnumber of input neurons in your neural net. If using .dat files, each\nfile must contain a linear list of input values, with the same number\nof values as the number of input neurons in your neural net.\nNext, prepare an input data configuration file, called inputData.txt\ncontaining a list of the .bmp or .dat filenames, one per line. If the\ndata is for training, then also list the target output values for each\ninput sample after the filename, like this:\nimages\/thumbnails\/test-918.bmp -1 1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1\nimages\/thumbnails\/test-919.bmp -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 1 -1\nimages\/thumbnails\/test-920.bmp -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 1 -1 -1 -1\nimages\/thumbnails\/test-921.bmp -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 1 -1 -1 -1 -1\netc. . .\n\nThe path and filename cannot contain any spaces.\nThe path_prefix directive can be used to specify a string to be attached\nto the front of all subsequent filenames, or until the next path_prefix\ndirective. For example, the previous example could be written:\n path_prefix = images\/thumbnails\/\n test-918.bmp\n test-919.bmp\n test-920.bmp\n test-921.bmp\n etc. . .\n\nFor more information on the .bmp file format, see this Wikipedia\narticle..\nFor more information on the neural2d .dat binary format, see this wiki\npage.\nand the design\nnotes.\nTopology file\nIn addition to the input data config file (inputData.txt), you'll also\nneed a topology config file (typically named topology.txt by default)\nto define your neural net topology (the number and arrangement\nof neurons and connections). Its format is described in a later\nsection.  A typical one looks like this example:\ninput size 32x32  \nlayer1 size 32x32 from input radius 8x8  \nlayer2 size 16x16 from layer1  \noutput size 1x10 from layer2  \n\nThen run neuron2d (optionally with the web browser interface) and\nexperiment with the parameters until the net is adequately trained,\nthen save the weights in a file for later use.\nIf you run the web interface, you can change the global parameters\nfrom the GUI while the neural2d program is running. If you run the\nneural2d console program without the GUI interface, there is no way\nto interact with it while running. Instead, you'll need to examine and\nmodify the parameters in the code at the top of the files neural2d.cpp\nand neural2d-core.cpp.\nThe 2D in neural2d\nIn a simple traditional neural net model, the neurons are arranged in\na column in each layer:\n\nIn neural2d, you can specify a rectangular arrangement of neurons in\neach layer, such as:\n\nThe neurons can be sparsely connected to mimic how retinal neurons\nare connected in biological brains. For example, if a radius of \"1x1\"\nis specified in the topology config file, each neuron on the right\n(destination) layer will connect to a circular patch of neurons in the\nleft (source) layer as shown here (only a single neuron on the right\nside is shown connected in this picture so you can see what's going on,\nbut imagine all of them connected in the same pattern):\n\nThe pattern that is projected onto the source layer is elliptical. (Layers\nconfigured as convolution filters work slightly differently; see the\nlater section about convolution filtering.)\nHere are some projected connection patterns for various radii:\nradius 0x0\n\nradius 1x1\n\nradius 2x2\n\nradius 3x1\n\nConvolution filtering\nAny layer other than the input layer can be configured as a convolution\nfilter layer by specifying a convolve-matrix specification for the\nlayer in the topology config file.  The neurons are still called neurons,\nbut their operation differs in the following ways:\n\n\nThe connection pattern to the source layer is defined by the convolution\nmatrix (kernel) dimensions (not by a radius parameter)\n\n\nThe connection weights are initialized from the convolution matrix,\nand are constant throughout the life of the net.\n\n\nThe transfer function is automatically set to the identity function\n(not by a tf parameter).\n\n\nFor example, the following line in the topology config file defines a\n3x3 convolution matrix for shrarpening the source layer:\n layerConv1 size 64x64 from input convolve {{0,-1,0},{-1,5,-1},{0,-1,0}}\n\nWhen a convolution matrix is specified for a layer, you cannot also\nspecify a radius parameter for that layer, as the convolution matrix\nsize determines the size and shape of the rectangle of neurons in the\nsource layer. You also cannot also specify a tf parameter, because the\ntransfer function on a convolution layer is automatically set to be the\nidentity function.\nThe elements of the convolution matrix are stored as connection weights\nto the source neurons. Connection weights on convolution layers are not\nupdated by the back propagation algorithm, so they remain constant for\nthe life of the net.\nFor illustrations of various convolution kernels, see\nthis Wikipedia article\nIn the following illustration, the topology config file defines a\nconvolution filter with a 2x2 kernel that is applied to the input layer,\nthen the results are combined with a reduced-resolution fully-connected\npathway. The blue connections in the picture are the convolution\nconnections; the green connections are regular neural connections:\ninput size 8x8\nlayerConvolve size 8x8 from input convolve {{-1,2},{-1,2}}\nlayerReducedRes size 4x4 from input\noutput size 2 from layerConvolve\noutput size 2 from layerReducedRes\n\n\nConvolution networking and pooling\nA convolution network\nlayer is\nlike a convolution filter layer, except that the kernel participates in\nbackprop training, and everything inside the layer is replicated N times\nto train N separate kernels. A convolution network layer is said to have\ndepth N. A convolution network layer has depth * X * Y neurons.\nAny layer other than the input or output layer can be configured as\na convolution networking layer by specifying a layer depth > 1, and\nspecifying the kernel size with a convolve parameter. For example,\nto train 40 kernels of size 7x7 on an input image of 64x64 pixels:\n  input size 64x64\n  layerConv size 40*64x64 from input convolve 7x7\n  . . .\n\nA pooling layer\ndown-samples the previous layer by finding the average or maximum in\npatches of source neurons.  A pooling layer is defined in the topology\nconfig file by specifying a pool parameter on a layer.\nIn the topology config syntax, the pool parameter requires the argument\n\"avg\" or \"max\" followed by the operator size, For example, in a\nconvolution network pipeline of depth 20, you might have these layers:\n  input size 64x64\n  layerConv size 20*64x64 from input convolve 5x5\n  layerPool size 20*16x16 from layerConv pool max 4x4\n  . . .\n\nLayer depth\nAll layers have a depth, whether explicit or implicit. Layer depth is\nspecified in the topology config file in the layer size parameter by an\ninteger and asterisk before the layer size. If the depth is not specified,\nit defaults to one. For example:\n\n\nsize 10*64x64 means 64x64 neurons, depth 10\n\n\nsize 64x64 means 64x64 neurons, depth 1\n\n\nsize 1*64x64 also means 64x64 neurons, depth 1\n\n\nsize 10*64 means 64x1 neurons, depth 10 (the Y dimension defaults to 1)\n\n\nThe primary purpose of layer depth is to allow convolution network\nlayers to train multiple kernels.  However, the concept of layer depth\nis generalized in neural2d, allowing any layer to have any depth and\nconnect to any other layer of any kind with any depth.\nThe way two layers are connected depends on the relationship of the\nsource and destination layer depths as shown below:\n\n\n\nRelationship\nHow connected\n\n\n\n\nsrc depth == dst depth\nconnect only to the corresponding depth in source\n\n\nsrc depth != dst depth\nfully connect across all depths\n\n\n\nTopology config file format\nHere is the grammar of the topology config file:\n\nlayer-name parameters := parameter [ parameters ]\n\n\nparameters := parameter [ parameters ]\n\n\nparameter :=\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0input | output | layername\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0size dxy-spec\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0from layer-name\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0channel channel-spec\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0radius xy-spec\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0tf transfer-function-spec\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0convolve filter-spec\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0convolve xy-spec\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0pool { max | avg } xy-spec\n\n\ndxy-spec := [ integer * ] integer [ x integer ]\n\n\nxy-spec := integer [ x integer ]\n\n\nchannel-spec := R | G | B | BW\n\n\ntransfer-function-spec := tanh | logistic | linear | ramp | gaussian | relu\n\n\nfilter-spec := same {{,},{,}} syntax used for array initialization in C, C#, VB, Java, etc.\n\nRules:\n\n\nComment lines that begin with \"#\" and blank lines are ignored.\n\n\nThe first layer defined must be named \"input\".\n\n\nThe last layer defined must be named \"output\".\n\n\nThe hidden layers can be named anything beginning with \"layer\".\n\n\nThe argument for \"from\" must be a layer already defined.\n\n\nThe color channel parameter can be specified only on the input layer.\n\n\nIf a size parameter is omitted, the size is copied from the layer\nspecified in the from parameter.\n\n\nA radius parameter cannot be used on the same line with a convolve\nor pool parameter.\n\n\nThe same layer name can be defined multiple times with different\n\"from\" parameters.  This allows source neurons from more than one layer\nto be combined in one destination layer. The source layers can be any\nsize, but the repeated (the destination) layer must have the same size\nin each specification. For example, in the following, layerCombined is\nsize 16x16 and takes inputs from two source layers of different sizes:\n\n\n     input size 128x128  \n     layerVertical size 32x32 from input radius 1x8  \n     layerHorizontal size 16x16 from input radius 8x1  \n     layerCombined from layerHorizontal          <= assumes size 16x16 from the source layer  \n     layerCombined size 16x16 from layerVertical <= repeated destination, must match 16x16  \n     output size 1 from layerCombined  \n\n\nIn the xy-spec  and in the X,Y part of the dxy-spec, you may\nspecify one or two dimensions.  Spaces are not allowed in the size\nspec. If only one dimension is given, the other is assumed to be 1.\nFor example:\n\n\n\"8x8\" means 64 neurons in an 8 x 8 arrangement.\n\"8x1\" means a row of 8 neurons\n\"1x8\" means a column of 8 neurons.\n\"8\" means the same as \"8x1\"\n\nTopology config file examples\nHere are a few complete topology config files and the nets they specify.\ninput size 4x4\nlayer1 size 3x3 from input\nlayer2 size 2x2 from layer1\noutput size 1 from layer2\n\n\ninput size 4x4\nlayer1 size 1x4 from input\nlayer2 size 3x1 from layer1\noutput size 1 from layer2\n\n\ninput size 4x4\noutput size 4x1 from input radius 0x2\n\n\ninput size 16x16\nlayer1 size 4x4 from input radius 1x1\noutput size 7x1 from layer1\n\n\n# In the picture that follows, layerVertical is the set of 4 neurons\n# in the upper part of the picture, and layerHorizontal is the lower\n# set of 4 neurons.\n\ninput size 6x6\nlayerHorizontal size 2x2 from input radius 2x0\nlayerVertical size 2x2 from input radius 0x2\noutput size 1 from layerHorizontal\noutput size 1 from layerVertical\n\n\n# This example shows how vertical and horizontal image features can be\n# extracted through separate paths and combined in a subsequent layer.\n\ninput size 4x4\n\nlayerH1 size 1x4 from input radius 4x0\nlayerH2 size 1x4 from layerH1\nlayerH3 size 1x4 from layerH2\n\nlayerV1 size 4x1 from input radius 0x4\nlayerV2 size 4x1 from layerV1\nlayerV3 size 4x1 from layerV2\n\noutput size 2 from layerV3\noutput size 2 from layerH3\n\n\nHow-do-I X?\nHow do I run the command-line program?\nRun neural2d with three arguments specifying the topology configuration,\ninput data configuration, and where to store the weights if training\nsucceeds:\n .\/neural2d topology.txt inputData.txt weights.txt\n\nHow do I run the GUI interface?\nFirst launch the neural2d program with the -p option:\n .\/neural2d topology.txt inputData.txt weights.txt -p\n\nThen open a web browser and point it at\nhttp:\/\/localhost:24080 .\nIf your firewall complains, you may need to allow access to TCP port\n24080.\nHow do I disable the GUI interface?\nRun CMake with the -DWEBSERVER=OFF option. Or if you are using\nyour own home-grown Makefiles, you can define the preprocessor\nmacro DISABLE_WEBSERVER. For example, with gnu compilers, add\n-DDISABLE_WEBSERVER to the g++ command line. Alternatively, you can\nundefine the macro ENABLE_WEBSERVER in neural2d.h.\nWhen the web server is disabled, there is no remaining dependency on\nPOSIX sockets.\nAlso see the illustrations above.\nHow do I use my own data instead of the digits images?\nFor binary input data, create your own directory of BMP image\nfiles or .dat binary files, and an input data config file\n(inputData.txt) that follows the same format as shown in the\nexamples elsewhere. Then define a topology config\nfile with the appropriate number of network inputs and\noutputs, then run the neural2d program.\nOr if you don't want to use .bmp image files or .dat binary files for\ninput, make an input config file containing all the literal input values\nand the target output values.\nSee above for more information on the input formats.\nHow do I use a trained net on new data?\nIt's all about the weights file. After the net has been successfully\ntrained, save the internal connection weights in a weights file. That's\ntypically done in neural2d.cpp by calling the member function\nsaveWeights(filename).\nThe weights you saved can be loaded back into a neural net of the same\ntopology using the member function loadWeights(filename). Once the net\nhas been loaded with weights, it can be used applied to new data by\ncalling feedForward(). Prior to calling feedForward(), you'll want to\nset a couple of parameters:\n myNet.repeatInputSamples = false;\n myNet.reportEveryNth = 1;\n\nThis is normally done in neural2d.cpp.\nYou'll need to prepare a new input data config file (default name\ninputData.txt) that contains a list of only those new input data images\nthat you want the net to process.\nHow do I train on the MNIST handwritten digits data set?\nSee the instructions in the wiki.\nHow do I change the learning rate parameter?\nIn the command-line program, you can set the eta parameter or change it\nby directly setting the eta member of the Net object, like this:\n myNet.eta = 0.1;\n\nWhen using the web interface, you can change the eta parameter (and\nother parameters) in the GUI at any time, even while the network is busy\nprocessing input data.\nAlso see the Parameter\nList\nin the wiki.\nAre the output neurons binary or floating point?\nThey are interpreted in whatever manner you train them to be, but you\ncan only train the outputs to take values in the range that the transfer\nfunction is capable of producing.\nIf you're training a net to output binary values, it's best if you use\nthe maxima of the transfer function to represent the two binary values.\nFor example, when using the default tanh() transfer function, train\nthe outputs to be -1 and +1 for false and true. When using the logistic\ntransfer function, train the outputs to be 0 and 1.\nHow do I use a different transfer function?\nYou can add a \"tf\" parameter to any layer definition line in\nthe topology config file.  The argument to tf can be \"tanh\",\n\"logistic\", \"linear\", \"ramp\", \"gaussian\", or \"relu\".  The\ntransfer function you specify will be used by all the neurons\nin that layer.  Here are the graphs of the built-in transfer\nfunctions.\nIn the topology config file, the tf parameter is specified as in this\nexample:\n layerHidden1 size 64x64 from input radius 3x3 tf linear\n\nYou can add new transfer functions by following the examples in\nneural2d-core.cpp.  There are two places to change: first find where\ntransferFunctionTanh() is defined and add your new transfer function and\nits derivative there. Next, locate the constructor for class Neuron and\nadd a new else-if clause there, following the examples.\nHow do I define a convolution filter?\nIn the topology config file, any layer defined with a convolve\nparameter and a list of constant weights will operate as a convolution\nfilter applied to the source layer.  The syntax is of the form:\n layer2 size 64x64 from input convolve {{1,0,-1},{0,0,0},{-1,0,1}}\n\nAlso see above for more information.\nSee this article for the difference between\nconvolution filter and convolution networking.\nHow do I define convolution networking and pooling?\nIn the topology config file, define a layer with an X,Y size and a depth\n(number of kernels to train), and add a convolve parameter to specify\nthe kernel size. For example, to train 40 kernels of size 7x7 on an\ninput image of 64x64 pixels:\n input size 64x64  \n layerConv size 40*64x64 from input convolve 7x7\n . . .\n\nTo define a pooling layer, add a pool parameter, followed by the argument\n\"avg\" or \"max,\" followed by the operator size, e.g.:\n layerConv size 10*32x32 ...\n layerPool size 10*8x8 from layerConv pool max 4x4\n . . .\n\nAlso see above for more information.\nHow do the color image pixels get converted to floating point for the input layer?\nThat's in the ImageReaderBMP class in neural2d-core.cpp. The default\nversion provided converts each RGB pixel to a single floating point\nvalue in the range -1.0 to 1.0.\nBy default, the three color channels are converted to monochrome and\nnormalized to the range -1.0 to 1.0. That can be changed at runtime by\nsetting the colorChannel member of the Net object to R, G, B, or BW prior\nto calling feedForward(). E.g., to use only the green color channel of\nthe images, use:\nmyNet.colorChannel = NNet::G;\n\nThe color conversion can also be specified in the topology config file on\nthe line that defines the input layer by setting the \"channel\" parameter\nto R, G, B, or BW, e.g.:\ninput size 64x64 channel G\n\nThere is no conversion when inputting floating point data directly from a\n.dat file, or from literal values embedded in the input data config file.\nHow can I use .jpg and .png images as inputs to the net?\nCurrently only .bmp images files are supported. This is because the\nuncompressed BMP format is so simple that we can use simple, standard\nC\/C++ to read the image data without any dependencies on third-party\nimage libraries.\nTo support a new input file format, derive a new subclass\nfrom class ImageReader and implement its getData() member\nfollowing the examples of the existing image readers. For\nmore information on the input data readers, see the design\nnotes.\nHow can I find my way through the source code?\nHere is a little map of the important files:\n\nAlso see the class relationship diagram in the project root directory.\nWhy does the net error rate stay high? Why doesn't my net learn?\nNeural nets are finicky. Try different network topologies. Try starting\nwith a larger eta values and reduce it incrementally. It could also\nbe due to redundancy in the input data, or mislabeled target output\nvalues. Or you may need more training samples.\nWhat other parameters do I need to know about?\nCheck out the list of parameters in the\nwiki.\nLicenses\nThe neural2d program and its documentation are\ncopyrighted and licensed under the terms of the MIT\nlicense.

It is not ready for use other than for people who have very basic needs, or are willing to help with the development. Because of this, it is currently very verbose and makes heavy use of the serial connection so you can see what's going on. That said, if you are reasonably familiar with Arduino or embedded development you might find it useful. I am publishing it in this early stage mostly because I am myself just starting out with C++ and could use all the help I can get. If you find errors or bad code just let me know and I'll work on fixing it!\nThere are a couple other options that are probably better suited if you are using a vanilla Arduino and not a Spark Core. First is Arduino HTTP library from Adrian McEwen. It depends on the Arduino Ethernet API Library though, which may or may not make sense in your implementation. Second there is HTTPClient from Interactive Matter but it also depends on the same Arduino Ethernet Library. Both of these libraries are orders of magnitude more mature than this one. In the future, it might very well make more sense to reuse a lot of code from these other libraries but to get rid of the dependencies rather than reimplementing things again.\nExample usage\n#include \"application.h\"\n\n\/**\n* Declaring the variables.\n*\/\nunsigned int nextTime = 0;    \/\/ Next time to contact the server\nHttpClient http;\n\n\/\/ Headers currently need to be set at init, useful for API keys etc.\nhttp_header_t headers[] = {\n    \/\/  { \"Content-Type\", \"application\/json\" },\n    \/\/  { \"Accept\" , \"application\/json\" },\n    { \"Accept\" , \"*\/*\"},\n    { NULL, NULL } \/\/ NOTE: Always terminate headers will NULL\n};\n\nhttp_request_t request;\nhttp_response_t response;\n\nvoid setup() {\n    Serial.begin(9600);\n}\n\nvoid loop() {\n    if (nextTime > millis()) {\n        return;\n    }\n\n    Serial.println();\n    Serial.println(\"Application>\\tStart of Loop.\");\n    \/\/ Request path and body can be set at runtime or at setup.\n    request.hostname = \"www.timeapi.org\";\n    request.port = 80;\n    request.path = \"\/utc\/now\";\n\n    \/\/ The library also supports sending a body with your request:\n    \/\/request.body = \"{\\\"key\\\":\\\"value\\\"}\";\n\n    \/\/ Get request\n    http.get(request, response, headers);\n    Serial.print(\"Application>\\tResponse status: \");\n    Serial.println(response.status);\n\n    Serial.print(\"Application>\\tHTTP Response Body: \");\n    Serial.println(response.body);\n\n    nextTime = millis() + 10000;\n}\n\n\n","114":"Vinduino\nThe Vinduino project started from the necessity to manage irrigation in my small Southern California vineyard, by monitoring soil moisture at different depths and at several vineyard locations.\nSoil moisture monitoring systems have been around for decades, but they cost hundreds to thousands of dollars and -because these systems are proprietary- there will be ongoing cost to customize and maintain these systems.

Once you're familiar with that process, install this plugin with this command:\nnpm install grunt-nodemon --save-dev\nThen add this line to your project's Gruntfile.js gruntfile:\ngrunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-nodemon');\nDocumentation\nMinimal Usage\nThe minimal usage of grunt-nodemon runs with a script specified:\nnodemon: {\n  dev: {\n    script: 'index.js'\n  }\n}\nUsage with all available options set\nnodemon: {\n  dev: {\n    script: 'index.js',\n    options: {\n      args: ['dev'],\n      nodeArgs: ['--debug'],\n      callback: function (nodemon) {\n        nodemon.on('log', function (event) {\n          console.log(event.colour);\n        });\n      },\n      env: {\n        PORT: '8181'\n      },\n      cwd: __dirname,\n      ignore: ['node_modules\/**'],\n      ext: 'js,coffee',\n      watch: ['server'],\n      delay: 1000,\n      legacyWatch: true\n    }\n  },\n  exec: {\n    options: {\n      exec: 'less'\n    }\n  }\n}\nAdvanced Usage\nA common use case is to run nodemon with other tasks concurrently. It is also common to open a browser tab when starting a server, and reload that tab when the server code changes. These workflows can be achieved with the following config, which uses a custom options.callback function, and grunt-concurrent to run nodemon, node-inspector, and watch in a single terminal tab:\nconcurrent: {\n  dev: {\n    tasks: ['nodemon', 'node-inspector', 'watch'],\n    options: {\n      logConcurrentOutput: true\n    }\n  }\n},\nnodemon: {\n  dev: {\n    script: 'index.js',\n    options: {\n      nodeArgs: ['--debug'],\n      env: {\n        PORT: '5455'\n      },\n      \/\/ omit this property if you aren't serving HTML files and \n      \/\/ don't want to open a browser tab on start\n      callback: function (nodemon) {\n        nodemon.on('log', function (event) {\n          console.log(event.colour);\n        });\n        \n        \/\/ opens browser on initial server start\n        nodemon.on('config:update', function () {\n          \/\/ Delay before server listens on port\n          setTimeout(function() {\n            require('open')('http:\/\/localhost:5455');\n          }, 1000);\n        });\n\n        \/\/ refreshes browser when server reboots\n        nodemon.on('restart', function () {\n          \/\/ Delay before server listens on port\n          setTimeout(function() {\n            require('fs').writeFileSync('.rebooted', 'rebooted');\n          }, 1000);\n        });\n      }\n    }\n  }\n},\nwatch: {\n  server: {\n    files: ['.rebooted'],\n    options: {\n      livereload: true\n    }\n  } \n}\nNote that using the callback config above assumes you have open installed and are injecting a LiveReload script into your HTML file(s). You can use grunt-inject to inject the LiveReload script.\nRequired property\nscript\nType: String\nScript that nodemon runs and restarts when changes are detected.\nOptions\nargs\nType: Array of Strings\nList of arguments to be passed to your script.\nnodeArgs\nType: Array of Strings\nList of arguments to be passed to node. The most common argument is --debug or --debug-brk to start a debugging server.\ncallback\nType:  Function\nDefault:\nfunction(nodemon) {\n  \/\/ By default the nodemon output is logged\n  nodemon.on('log', function(event) {\n    console.log(event.colour);\n  });\n};\nCallback which receives the nodemon object. This can be used to respond to changes in a running app, and then do cool things like LiveReload a web browser when the app restarts. See the nodemon docs for the full list of events you can tap into.\nignore\nType: Array of String globs Default: ['node_modules\/**']\nList of ignored files specified by a glob pattern relative to the watched folder. Here is an explanation of how to use the patterns to ignore files.\next\nType: String Default: 'js'\nString with comma separated file extensions to watch. By default, nodemon watches .js files.\nwatch\nType: Array of Strings Default: ['.']\nList of folders to watch for changes. By default nodemon will traverse sub-directories, so there's no need in explicitly including sub-directories.\ndelay\nType: Number Default: 1000\nDelay the restart of nodemon by a number of milliseconds when compiling a large amount of files so that the app doesn't needlessly restart after each file is changed.\nlegacyWatch\nType: Boolean Default: false\nIf you wish to force nodemon to start with the legacy watch method. See https:\/\/github.com\/remy\/nodemon\/blob\/master\/faq.md#help-my-changes-arent-being-detected for more details.\ncwd\nType: String\nThe current working directory to run your script from.\nenv\nType: Object\nHash of environment variables to pass to your script.\nexec\nType: String\nYou can use nodemon to execute a command outside of node. Use this option to specify a command as a string with the argument being the script parameter above. You can read more on exec here.\nChangelog\n0.3.0 - Updated to nodemon 1.2.0.\n0.2.1 - Updated README on npmjs.org with correct options.\n0.2.0 - Updated to nodemon 1.0, added new callback option.\nBreaking changes:\n\noptions.file is now script and is a required property. Some properties were changed to match nodemon: ignoredFiles -> ignore, watchedFolders -> watch, delayTime -> delay, watchedExtensions -> ext(now a string) to match nodemon.\n\n0.1.2 - nodemon can now be listed as a dependency in the package.json and grunt-nodemon will resolve the nodemon.js file's location correctly.\n0.1.1 - Added legacyWatch option thanks to @jonursenbach.\n0.1.0 - Removed debug and debugBrk options as they are encapsulated by the nodeArgs option.\nBreaking changes:\n\nConfigs with the debug or debugBrk options will no longer work as expected. They simply need to be added to nodeArgs.\n\n0.0.10 - Added nodeArgs option thanks to @eugeneiiim.\n0.0.9 - Fixed bug when using cwd with ignoredFiles.\n0.0.8 - Added error logging for incorrectly installed nodemon.\n0.0.7 - Added debugBreak option thanks to @bchu.\n0.0.6 - Added env option.\n0.0.5 - Added cwd option.\n0.0.4 - Added nodemon as a proper dependency.\n0.0.3 - Uses local version of nodemon for convenience and versioning.\n0.0.2 - Removes .nodemonignore if it was previously generated and then the ignoredFiles option is removed.\n0.0.1 - Added warning if nodemon isn't installed as a global module.\n0.0.0 - Initial release\n","121":"D3xter\n\nAbout\n\nSimple and powerful syntax to make common charts with minimal code.\nHighly flexible plotting for deep customization.\nSensible defaults but easy to configure when desired.\nEasily extendable via familiar D3.js syntax.\n\nInstall\nbower install d3xter\nDocumentation\nFor full documentation complete with examples, visit this page.\nTesting and Contribution\nRun unit tests by opening test\/test.html in the browser.\nPull requests welcome!\nLicense\nThe MIT License (MIT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2014 Nathan Epstein\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and\/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

VIE is developed as part of the EU-funded IKS project.\n\n\nIn French, vie means life, showcasing how VIE makes your website come alive\nIn English, vie means striving for victory or superiority\n\nVIE development is now targeting a 2.0 release. Read this blog post to find out the changes from VIE 1.0. There is also a good introductory post on VIE on the IKS blog.\nVIE integration in nutshell\nAdding VIE to your system is as easy as:\n\nMark up your pages with RDFa annotations\nInclude vie.js into the pages\nImplement Backbone.sync\n\nChanges\nPlease refer to the CHANGES.md document.\nCommon representation of content on HTML level\nA web editing tool has to understand the contents of the page. It has to understand what parts of the page should be editable, and how they connect together. If there is a list of news for instance, the tool needs to understand it enough to enable users to add new news items. The easy way of accomplishing this is to add some semantic annotations to the HTML pages. These annotations could be handled via Microformats, HTML5 microdata, but the most power lies with RDFa.\nRDFa is a way to describe the meaning of particular HTML elements using simple attributes. For example:\n<div id=\"myarticle\" typeof=\"http:\/\/rdfs.org\/sioc\/ns#Post\" about=\"http:\/\/example.net\/blog\/news_item\">\n    <h1 property=\"dcterms:title\">News item title<\/h1>\n    <div property=\"sioc:content\">News item contents<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\nHere we get all the necessary information for making a blog entry editable:\n\ntypeof tells us the type of the editable object. On typical CMSs this would map to a content model or a database table\nabout gives us the identifier of a particular object. On typical CMSs this would be the object identifier or database row primary key\nproperty ties a particular HTML element to a property of the content object. On a CMS this could be a database column\n\nAs a side effect, this also makes pages more understandable to search engines and other semantic tools. So the annotations are not just needed for UI, but also for SEO.\nCommon representation of content on JavaScript level\nHaving contents of a page described via RDFa makes it very easy to extract the content model into JavaScript. We can have a common utility library for doing this, but we also should have a common way of keeping track of these content objects. Enter Backbone.js:\n\nBackbone supplies structure to JavaScript-heavy applications by providing models with key-value binding and custom events, collections with a rich API of enumerable functions, views with declarative event handling, and connects it all to your existing application over a RESTful JSON interface.\n\nWith Backbone, the content extracted from the RDFa-annotated HTML page is easily manageable via JavaScript. Consider for example:\nv = new VIE();\nv.use(new v.RdfaService());\nv.load({element: jQuery('#myarticle')}).from('rdfa').execute().success(function(entities) {\n    _.forEach(entities, function(entity) {\n        entity.set({'dcterms:title': 'Hello, world'});\n        entity.save(null, {\n            success: function(savedModel, response) {\n                alert(\"Your article '\" + savedModel.get('dcterms:title') + \"' was saved to server\");\n            }\n        });\n    })\n    console.log(\"We got \" + entities.length + \" editable objects from the page\");\n});\n\nThe classic VIE API will also work:\nvar v = new VIE({classic: true});\nvar objectInstance = v.RDFaEntities.getInstance(jQuery('#myarticle'));\nobjectInstance.set({'dcterms:title': 'Hello, world'});\nobjectInstance.save(null, {\n    success: function(savedModel, response) {\n        alert(\"Your article '\" + savedModel.get('dcterms:title') + \"' was saved to server\");\n    }\n});\n\nThis JS would work across all the different CMS implementations. Backbone.js provides a quite nice RESTful implementation of communicating with the server with JSON, but it can be easily overridden with CMS-specific implementation by just implementing a new Backbone.sync method.\nExample\nThere is a full static HTML example of VIE at work. Saving outputs the edited contents as JSON into the JavaScript console:\n\nExample with Hallo\n\nBe sure to read the annotated VIE source code for API documentation.\nI\/O operations\nAll Input\/Output operations of VIE are based on the jQuery Deferred object, which means that you can attach callbacks to them either before they run, or also after they've been run.\nThe operations may either succeed, in which case the then callbacks will fire, or be rejected, in which case the fail callbacks will fire. Any then callbacks will fire in either case.\nDependencies\nVIE uses the following JavaScript libraries:\n\njQuery for DOM manipulation and Deferreds\nBackbone.js for entities (models) and collections\nUnderscore.js for various JavaScript utilities\n\nSome functionality in VIE additionally uses:\n\nRdfQuery as a triplestore and for reasoning over rules\n\nIntegrations\n\nCreate\nGoogle Web Toolkit\nSymfony2\nPalsu\n\nUsing VIE on Node.js\nVIE is a CommonJS library that works on both browser and the server. On Node.js you can install it with:\nnpm install vie\n\nHere is a simple Node.js script that uses VIE for parsing RDFa:\nvar jQuery = require('jquery');\nvar vie = require('vie');\n\n\/\/ Instantiate VIE\nvar VIE = new vie.VIE();\n\n\/\/ Enable the RDFa service\nVIE.use(new VIE.RdfaService());\n\nvar html = jQuery('<p xmlns:dc=\"http:\/\/purl.org\/dc\/elements\/1.1\/\" about=\"http:\/\/www.example.com\/books\/wikinomics\">In his latest book <cite property=\"dc:title\">Wikinomics<\/cite>, <span property=\"dc:creator\">Don Tapscott<\/span> explains deep changes in technology, demographics and business.<\/p>');\n\n\/\/ \nVIE.load({element: html}).from('rdfa').execute().done(function() {\n\n  var objectInstance = VIE.entities.get('http:\/\/www.example.com\/books\/wikinomics');\n\n  console.log(objectInstance.get('dc:title'));\n\n});\n\nDevelopment\nVIE development is coordinated using Git at bergie\/VIE.\nFeel free to report issues or send pull requests if you have ideas for pushing VIE forward. Contributions that include their own unit tests appreciated!\nDevelopment discussions happen on the VIE mailing list and the #iks channel on Freenode. See also VIE on Ohloh.\nCode organization\nVIE source code is inside the src directory. Each separate unit of functionality should be handled in its own file, with the src\/VIE.js being the entry point to the system.\n\nBuilding VIE\nThe VIE library consists of many individual pieces that we merge together in the build process. You'll need Grunt. Then just run:\n$ grunt build\n\nThe built VIE library will appear in the dist folder.\nCore-only distribution\nIn addition to the regular full build, there is also a slimmer build of VIE available that only includes the core parts of the library and no external service. To build that instead, run:\n$ grunt build:core\n\nRunning Unit Tests\nDirect your browser to the test\/index.html file to run VIE's QUnit tests.\nUnit tests on Node.js\nThe Grunt testing setup includes multiple parts. With it, you can test the library on both Node.js and a headless browser. Run:\n$ grunt test\n\nor:\n$ npm test\n\nAutomatic unit tests\nYou can also run the Grunt setup in watch mode, where any change in VIE sources or tests will trigger a rebuild and test run:\n$ grunt watch\n\nContinuous integration\nVIE uses Travis for continuous integration. Simply add your fork there and every time you push you'll get the tests run.\n\n\n","124":"jQuery Image Preload Plugin\nThe jQuery.imgpreload plugin lets you preload images before and after the DOM has loaded.\nTested: IE6, IE7, IE8, IE9+, FF, Chrome, Safari\nUsage\nCallbacks\nThe following are available callbacks, you may change them globally or override the defaults by passing the settings object to the imgpreload method.\n$.fn.imgpreload.defaults =\n{\n    each: null \/\/ callback invoked when each image is loaded\n    , all: null \/\/ callback invoked when all images have loaded\n};\n\nAfter DOM loaded\nThe following illustrates using the plugin to preload images after the dom has loaded (e.g. using jQuery selectors):\n$('#content img').imgpreload(function()\n{\n    \/\/ callback invoked when all images have loaded\n    \/\/ this = array of dom image objects\n    \/\/ check for success with: $(this[i]).data('loaded')\n});\n\n$('img.logos').imgpreload\n({\n    each: function()\n    {\n        \/\/ callback invoked when each image is loaded\n        \/\/ this = dom image object\n        \/\/ check for success with: $(this).data('loaded')\n    },\n    all: function()\n    {\n        \/\/ callback invoked when all images have loaded\n        \/\/ this = array of dom image objects\n        \/\/ check for success with: $(this[i]).data('loaded')\n    }\n});\n\nBefore DOM loaded\nTo preload images before the dom has loaded, for instance in the head of the document, you would have to use specific image paths.\n$.imgpreload('\/images\/a.gif',function()\n{\n    \/\/ callback invoked when all images have loaded\n    \/\/ this = array of dom image objects\n    \/\/ check for success with: $(this[i]).data('loaded')\n});\n\nYou can pass a single image path (as above) or an array of image paths.\n$.imgpreload(['\/images\/a.gif','\/images\/b.gif'],function()\n{\n    \/\/ this = array of dom image objects\n    \/\/ check for success with: $(this[i]).data('loaded')\n    \/\/ callback executes when all images are loaded\n});\n\neach and all callbacks are available to use.\n$.imgpreload(['\/images\/a.gif','\/images\/b.gif'],\n{\n    each: function()\n    {\n        \/\/ callback invoked when each image is loaded\n        \/\/ this = dom image object\n        \/\/ check for success with: $(this).data('loaded')\n    },\n    all: function()\n    {\n        \/\/ callback invoked when all images have loaded\n        \/\/ this = array of dom image objects\n        \/\/ check for success with: $(this[i]).data('loaded')\n    }\n});\n\n","125":"\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nRecon\nCode Intelligence for React Applications.\n\nWhat?\nRecon provides a new level of insight into your codebase allowing you to understand\nhow your components are being used, easily grep their complexity, draw dependency graphs,\nand isolate points for optimisation.\nOn top of this the raw information Recon provides gives a strong base for creating tools\n(such as living styleguides) which may need to plug in to component meta data.\nHow?\nThe core of Recon revolves around recon-engine.

No extra call to Meteor.subscribe() is required. Specify the name of the subscription along with any arguments.\nThe first argument, connection, is optional. If connecting to a different Meteor server, pass the DDP connection object in this first argument. If not specified, the first argument becomes the name of the subscription (string) and the default Meteor server connection will be used.\nThe prototype inherits from Array and is extended with the following methods:\n\n\n\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nchange([args...])\nChange the subscription's arguments.

Put the following in chatserver.py, update the user and chatroom info, and run it:\nfrom hermes.api import run_server\n\nbrain = { 'JID': 'brain@wb.com', 'NICK': 'brain', 'ADMIN': True }\npinky = { 'JID': 'pinky.suavo@wb.com', 'NICK': 'pinky' }\n\nchatrooms = {\n    'world-domination-planning': {\n        'JID': 'world.domination.planning@wb.com',\n        'PASSWORD': 'thesamethingwedoeverynight',\n        'SERVER': ('talk.google.com', 5223,),\n        'MEMBERS': [pinky, brain],\n    },\n}\n\nrun_server(chatrooms)\n\nInstallation\nAvailable from PyPI: http:\/\/pypi.python.org\/pypi\/hermes\/. pip is the recommended installation method:\npip install hermes\n\nCommands\nHermes interprets some messages as commands:\n\n\n\/mute - Mute the chatroom. Messages are queued up for whenever you unmute the chatroom.\n\n\n\/unmute - Unmute the chatroom. Receive all messages that were queued while the chatroom was muted.\n\n\n\/invite <handle> - Invite members to the chatroom. Available to admins only.\n\n\n\/kick <handle> - Kick members from the chatroom. Available to admins only.\n\n\n\/marco - Not sure if you're still connected to the chatroom? Chatroom replies to you (and only you) with \"polo\".\n\n\nExtensibility\nYou can extend the base chatroom class hermes.Chatroom to modify or add extra functionality.\nAdding a command_patterns static property to your class should be particularly useful for extensions.\nIt's a list of regular expression\/method name pairs. Each incoming message is tested against the regexes until a match is found.\nOn a match, the named instance method is invoked to handle the message instead of the default message-handling pipeline.\nSpecify the path to your creation as a string or the Class itself as the CLASS of your chatroom:\nfrom hermes.api import run_server, Chatroom\n\nclass BillyMaysChatroom(Chatroom):\n\tcommand_patterns = ((r'.*', 'shout'),)\n\n\tdef shout(self, sender, body, match):\n        body = body.upper() #SHOUT IT\n        self.broadcast(body)\n\nchatrooms = {\n    'world-domination-planning': {\n        'CLASS': 'BillyMaysChatroom',\n        'JID': 'world.domination.planning@wb.com',\n        'PASSWORD': 'thesamethingwedoeverynight',\n        'SERVER': ('talk.google.com', 5223,),\n        'MEMBERS': [pinky, brain],\n    },\n}\n\nrun_server(chatrooms)\n\nUpcoming Features\n\nPersistence: Allow chatroom configuration\/state\/history to be persisted\n\nIs it any good?\nYes.\nElaborate, you say? Hermes has been successfully used \"in production\" to run several chatrooms for the Crocodoc team since the first commit. It's good to have guinea pigs.\nLicense\nHermes is an ISC licensed library. See LICENSE for more details. If you insist on compensating me, I'd let you buy me a beer. Or just donate money to a good cause...that'd probably be best.\nCan I Contribute?\nYes, please do. Pull requests are great. I'll totally add a CONTRIBUTORS.txt when Hermes gets its first contributor.\n","133":"git-goggles Readme\ngit-goggles is a git management utilities that allows you to manage your source code as\nit evolves through its development lifecycle.\n\nOverview\nThis project accomplishes two things:\n\nManage the code review state of your branches\nGives a snapshot of the where your local branches are vs origin in terms of being ahead \/ behind on commits\n\nThere is a nice blog post describing the features along with screenshots at http:\/\/bit.ly\/git-goggles\n\nField Reference\nIn the table outputted by git-goggles, each row corresponds to a branch, with the following fields:\n\nStatus: the current status of your branch\n\n\nnew: this is a branch that has never been through the review process\nreview: this branch has code that needs to be reviewed\nmerge: everything has been reviewed, but needs to be merged into parent (same as done for being ahead)\ndone: reviewed and merged (doens't matter if you're behind but you can't be ahead)\n\n\n\nBranch: the branch name\n\nReview: how many commits have taken place since the last review\n\nAhead: how many commits are in your local branch that are not in origin\n\nBehind: how many commits are in origin that are not in your local branch\n\nPull & Push: whether your branches need to be pushed or pulled to track origin\n\n\ngreen checkbox: you don't need to pull\nred cross: you need to pull\nquestion mark: you either don't have a checked out copy of this branch or you need to prune your local tree\n\n\n\nModified: the last time that HEAD was modified (NOT the last time the review happened)\n\n\n\nInstallation\nTo install from PyPi you should run one of the following commands.

They say a pic is worth a 1000 words. Is it true to admit a .gif is worth a 1000 pics? \n  \nInclude in your project\n In your root\/build.gradle\nallprojects {\n  repositories {\n  ...\n  maven { url 'https:\/\/jitpack.io' }\n  }\n}  \n In your app\/build.gradle\ndependencies {\n  compile 'com.github.rjsvieira:morphos:1.0.0'\n}\nIntroducing Morphos : an animation wrapper.\nMorphos will take care of your views' animations without you having to write all that boring boilerplate code.\nInitialization\nMorphos are easy to interact with. Go ahead and create the following simple Morpho :\nView viewToAnimate = ... ;\nMorpho morph = new Morpho(viewToAnimate)\n  .translate(50,50,0,1500) \/\/ will translate the view (x=50,y=50,z=0) in 1500 milliseconds, \n  .rotationXY(45,45,2000); \/\/ will rotate the view by 45 degrees on both the X-axis and Y-axis in 2000 milliseconds\nYou can then animate it by doing\nmorph.animate(); \nWhich will then animate the desired Morphos using the default animation type (SEQUENTIAL).\nWhat if I want to reverse the animation? Sure, just do :\nmorph.reverse();\n Configuration \nCreate a Morpho\nMorpho morphoOne = new Morphos(view);\nConfigure the Morphos' animations\nAs of the first release, Morphos supports the 7 most basic and common animations.\nSince Morphos has plenty of combinations for interpolation, animation type, duration, etc, the user is allowed to configure them according to his needs.\nEvery animation configuration method returns the Morphos object itself, thus allowing the user to chain his preferred animations.\nNote : If the user does not specify the duration and\/or interpolator, the animation will assume a 0 second duration and the default interpolator.\nalpha(double value)\nalpha(double value, int duration)\nalpha(double value, int duration, Interpolator interpolator)\n\nscale(double valueX, double valueY)\nscale(double valueX, double valueY, int duration)\nscale(double valueX, double valueY, int duration, Interpolator interpolator)\n\ntranslationX(AnimationTarget target, float valueX)\ntranslationX(AnimationTarget target, float valueX, int duration)\ntranslationX(AnimationTarget target, float valueX, int duration, Interpolator interpolator)\n\ntranslationY(AnimationTarget target, float valueX)\ntranslationY(AnimationTarget target, float valueX, int duration)\ntranslationY(AnimationTarget target, float valueX, int duration, Interpolator interpolator)\n\ntranslationZ(AnimationTarget target, float valueX)\ntranslationZ(AnimationTarget target, float valueX, int duration)\ntranslationZ(AnimationTarget target, float valueX, int duration, Interpolator interpolator)\n\ntranslation(AnimationTarget target, float valueX, float valueY, float valueZ)\ntranslation(AnimationTarget target, float valueX, float valueY, float valueZ, int duration)\ntranslation(AnimationTarget target, float valueX, float valueY, float valueZ, int duration, Interpolator interpolator)\n\ndimensions(float width, float height)\ndimensions(float width, float height, int duration)\ndimensions(float width, float height, int duration, Interpolator interpolator)\n\nrotationXY(AnimationTarget target, double degreesX, double degreesY)\nrotationXY(AnimationTarget target, double degreesX, double degreesY, int duration)\nrotationXY(AnimationTarget target, double degreesX, double degreesY, int duration, Interpolator interpolator)\n\nrotation(AnimationTarget target, double degrees)\nrotation(AnimationTarget target, double degrees, int duration)\nrotation(AnimationTarget target, double degrees, int duration, Interpolator interpolator)\nSet a Listener to track the Morphos' animation process\nmorphoOne.setListener(new Animator.AnimatorListener() {\n  @Override\n  public void onAnimationStart(Animator animator) {\n      System.out.println(\"Start\");\n  }\n\n  @Override\n  public void onAnimationEnd(Animator animator) {\n      System.out.println(\"End\");\n  }\n\n  @Override\n  public void onAnimationCancel(Animator animator) {\n\n  }\n\n  @Override\n  public void onAnimationRepeat(Animator animator) {\n\n  }\n})  \n Animate() the Morpho\nThis can be done through one of the several methods created just to make the invocation easier.\nThe animate() method's default values are : \n\nAnimationType : SEQUENTIAL - All animations are executed one sequentially\nDuration : -1 - Since no duration was specified, -1 is assumed thus executing every animation in its given duration. For example : morphoOne.translate(100,0,0,3000).scale(2,2,2000).animate() will execute the translation animation in 3 seconds, followed by an upscale animation of 2 seconds\nInterpolator - The overall interpolator (LinearInterpolator)\nanimate()\nanimate(AnimationType type, int duration)\nanimate(AnimationType type, int duration, Interpolator interpolator)\nReverse\nAfter executing animate(), the user can rollback the animation by invoking the reverse() method.\nThe reverse method works just like the animate() method, having the same combinations and parameters.\nreverse()\nreverse(AnimationType type, int duration)\nreverse(AnimationType type, int duration, Interpolator interpolator)\nCancel\nIf the user wishes to cancel the on-going animation by any reason, he can do so by invoking the cancel method :\nmorphoOne.cancel();\nupdateView\nLike the method explicitly indicates, the user can update the view associated with the Morpho. This will clear every animation already configured for the given object.\nupdateView(View v) also invokes reset();\nmorphoOne.updateView(newView);\nReset\nIf by any chance the user wants to reset he Morpho and re-build it from scratch, he can do so by invoking the reset() method\nmorphoOne.reset()\nDispose\nLast but not least, if they user wishes to discard the Morphos object, he can invoke the dispose() method, thus clearing and preparing the Morphos' inner variables for garbage collection.\nmorphoOne.dispose();\n","141":"This is library project with a custom view that implements concept of Submit Button (https:\/\/dribbble.com\/shots\/1426764-Submit-Button?list=likes&offset=3) made by Colin Garven.\n###Demo###\n\n###Usage###\n <com.tuesda.submit.SubmitView\n        android:layout_centerInParent=\"true\"\n        android:id=\"@+id\/submit\"\n        android:layout_width=\"200dp\"\n        android:layout_height=\"200dp\" \/>\nmSubmit.setOnProgressStart(new SubmitView.OnProgressStart() {\n            @Override\n            public void progressStart() {\n                \/\/ do something when progress start\n            }\n        });\n        \n        mSubmit.setOnProgressDone(new SubmitView.OnProgressDone() {\n            @Override\n            public void progressDone() {\n                \/\/ do something when progress is done\n            }\n        });\n###public interface###\n\n\n\n\u51fd\u6570\u540d\n\u4f5c\u7528\n\n\n\n\nsetBackColor(int color)\n\u8bbe\u7f6e\u56fe\u6807\u80cc\u666f\u8272\uff0c\u9ed8\u8ba4\u662f\u7eff\u8272(0xff00cd97)\uff0c\u4e0a\u56feDemo\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e3a\u84dd\u8272(0xff0097cd)\n\n\nsetText(String str)\n\u8bbe\u7f6e\u6309\u94ae\u540d\u5b57\uff0c\u9ed8\u8ba4\u662fSubmit\n\n\nreset()\n\u5c06\u6309\u94ae\u91cd\u7f6e\u5230\u521d\u59cb\u72b6\u6001\n\n\nsetProgress(float progress)\n\u8bbe\u7f6e\u6b63\u5728\u6267\u884c\u5de5\u4f5c\u7684\u6267\u884c\u8fdb\u7a0b\n\n\nisProgressDone()\n\u6b63\u5728\u6267\u884c\u5de5\u4f5c\u662f\u5426\u5b8c\u6210\n\n\nsetOnProgressStart(OnProgressStart listener)\n\u8bbe\u7f6eprogress\u5f00\u59cb\u56de\u8c03\n\n\nsetOnProgressDone(OnProgressDone listener)\n\u8bbe\u7f6eprogress\u5b8c\u6210\u56de\u8c03\n\n\n\n","142":"SugaredListAnimations\nSugaredListAnimations is a library that pretends to add animations to your listview with minor changes to your already existing code.\nCurrently the available animations are:\n\nGoogle Plus alike\nGoogle Now alike\n\nVersion\n0.9 -

Here is how you do it.\npublic class OnboardingFragment extends Fragment {\n    private static final int REQ_PERMISSIONS = 101;\n\n    private final PermissionsRequester mPermissionsRequester = new PermissionsRequester() {\n        @Override public void performRequestPermissions(String[] permissions) {\n            \/\/ forward request to the system by calling fragment's method\n            requestPermissions(permissions, REQ_PERMISSIONS);\n        }\n    };\n    \n    @Override\n    public void onRequestPermissionsResult(int requestCode, String[] permissions, int[] grantResults) {\n        if (requestCode == REQ_PERMISSIONS) {\n            \/\/ forward response back to requester class for further processing\n            mPermissionsRequester.onRequestPermissionsResult(permissions, grantResults);\n        }\n    }\n    \n    @Override public void onViewCreated(View view, Bundle savedInstanceState) {\n        super.onViewCreated(view, savedInstanceState);\n        \n        mSubscription = RxPermissions.get(getActivity())\n            .request(mPermissionsRequester, \n                        Manifest.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE,\n                        Manifest.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE)\n            .subscribe(granted -> {\n                if (granted) {\n                    \/\/ permissions were granted, observable completes\n                } else {\n                    \/\/ user denied request\n                }\n            });\n    }\n    \n    @Override public void onDestroyView() {\n        mSubsrciption.unsubsribe();\n        mSubsrciption = null;\n        super.onDestroyView();\n    }\n    \n    public void onButtonClicked(View view) {\n        mPermissionsRequester.request();\n    }\n}\nObservable returned by RxPermissions.request() method does only complete when all requested permissions are granted. Until then it emitts false every time user denies a permission request. You can show user a better explanation of why the app needs these permissions and ask for permissions again. Use PermissionsRequester.request() method for triggering permissions request dialog once again.\nTests & stability\nAlthough this library has unit tests covering whole functionality described above, there is still no productive apps using it yet.\nCredits\nThis library was inspired by https:\/\/github.com\/tbruyelle\/RxPermissions, but it uses a bit different design allowing pure observation of permissions and follow up permissions request without necessity to create new observable.\nLicense\nCopyright (c) 2015, 2016 Sergej Shafarenka, halfbit.de\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n   http:\/\/www.apache.org\/licenses\/LICENSE-2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.\n\n","149":"JFreeChart - Future State Edition (FSE)\nThis is a development version of JFreeChart that has been branched from the\nJFreeChart 1.0.x series.

This requires AT LEAST JDK 1.6.0 to compile and, depending\non how I (and the other contributors) feel, in the future we may\nrequire JDK 1.7 or even a later version;\n\n\nJCommon is no longer a dependency (the subset of classes from JCommon that\nare still used have been incorporated directly in the source tree);\n\n\nThe aim is to modernise the JFreeChart API and code and have some fun with new\nstuff and NOT to be constrained by backwards compatibility.\nDavid Gilbert (david.gilbert@object-refinery.com)\nJFreeChart Project Leader\n\n","150":"About in_constexpr\nAn approach of detecting if inside a constexpr context in a constexpr function.\nBy being able to detect if we're within a constexpr context we can choose to implement\na runtime specific algorithm while having a different algorithm for doing something at compile time.\nThe approach is discussed in this post\nFeatures\n\nif (in_constexpr()\/in_runtime()) - Being able to detect if in runtime or compile time\nsmart_assert                     - constexpr friendly assert\n\nConstraints\n\nOnly tested on GCC 5+ and Clang 3.8+\nx86 only so far\nRuntime approach only works on linux (replacing code in the binary should work under windows for now)\nSee detailed descriptions about caveats here\nThe library must be statically linked\nThe initialization logic relies on being able to modify the .text segment of your program\n\nUsing the library\nBuilding and installing\nYou can compile and install this library using cmake. You will need to link this library in as a static library.\nYou can customize and install the library using the following:\ncmake <code directory> -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<install directory> && make -j && make install\n\nThen just link in as you would a normal library. You can try the examples in examples\/ to see how to use the library.\nUsing the API and an example\nTo test if this library is working, you can call in_constexpr::is_setup() to see if it is working. The library should automatically call the setup by means of the constructor\nattribute and so you shouldn't need to explicitly call in_constexpr::initialize() but if it's not happening automatically, you can call that function.\nThe library provides an  in_constexpr() and in_runtime() macro\/method that returns if a constexpr function is within which context. This can be used to provide different code paths in each case.\nNote, you can't do something like if (!in_constexpr())  due to those methods being a syntatic sugar. Use either if (in_constexpr()) or if (in_runtime()).\nThe library also provides a smart_assert which you can use regular assert but stil work within constexpr functions.\nYou can find more examples under the examples folder.\nconst int N_MAX            = 30;\nint factorial_cache[N_MAX] = {0};\n\nconstexpr int factorial(int n) {\n  smart_assert(n >= 0 && n < N_MAX, \"N >= 0 && N <= N_MAX\");\n\n  if (n == 0)\n    return 1;\n  else {\n    if (in_constexpr()) {\n      return n * factorial(n - 1);\n    } else {\n      std::cout << \"Calling factorial \" << n << std::endl;\n      \/\/ Since we're in runtime, we can cache results.\n      if (factorial_cache[n] == 0) {\n        factorial_cache[n] = n * factorial(n - 1);\n      }\n      return factorial_cache[n];\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nint main() {\n  volatile int a = 5;\n  volatile int b = 6;\n  std::cout << factorial(a) << std::endl;\n  std::cout << factorial(b) << std::endl;\n\n  constexpr int c = factorial(3);\n  \/\/ Compiler error!\n  \/\/ constexpr int d = factorial(-5);\n\n  std::cout << c << std::endl;\n  \/\/ std::cout << factorial(d) << std::endl;\n  return 0;\n}\nWill produce the following outputs\nCalling factorial 5\nCalling factorial 4\nCalling factorial 3\nCalling factorial 2\nCalling factorial 1\n120\nCalling factorial 6\nCalling factorial 5\n720\n6\n\n","151":"This code is obsolete and the activity moved to https:\/\/github.com\/idni\/tau under a new design\n","152":"This code is obsolete and the activity moved to https:\/\/github.com\/idni\/tau under a new design\n","153":"text_extraction\nThis code is the implementation of the method proposed in the paper \u201cMulti-script text extraction from natural scenes\u201d (Gomez & Karatzas), International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition, ICDAR2013.\nThis code should reproduce the same quantitative results published on the paper for the KAIST dataset (for the task of text segmentation at pixel level).

You just need\nto run:\n$ .\/DEPENDENCIES-INSTALLER.sh\nRequirements, installed by previous script\nRequires the following libraries. Versions are only orientative, it could work\nwith older and newer versions whenver the API was compatible.\n\nGNU C++ compiler (g++): v 4.7.2\nOnly in Linux systems: Lua 5.2 headers to tell APRIL-ANN the default system\npath for Lua modules (lua5.2-deb-multiarch.h header).\nBLAS implementation: ATLAS (v. 3), Intel MKL (v. 10.3.6), MacOS Accelerate Framework\nThreads posix (pthread)\nReadline (libreadline)\nOpenMP\nLAPACK library, offered by liblapack_atlas, mkl_lapack, or MacOS Accelerate Framework\nLAPACKE library when compiling with ATLAS\n\nThe following libreries are recommended, but optional, you will need to remove\nits package from the path profile_build_scripts\/package_list.lua:\n\n[OPTIONAL] libpng: if you want to open PNG images, package libpng.\n[OPTIONAL] libtiff: if you want to open TIFF images, package libtiff.\n[OPTIONAL] libz: support for open of GZIPPED files, package gzio.\n[OPTIONAL] libzip: support for open ZIP packages, package zip.\n\nFor perform computation on GPU, this optional library, which has an specific\nmake target:\n\n[OPTIONAL] CUDA and CUBLAS: release 4.2.6.\n\nCompilation\nFirst, it is mandatory to configure the repo PATH and other stuff.\nThis step is needed every time you start a session, and before compilation:\n$ . configure.sh\nSecond, you can compile the APRIL-ANN version which you need.\nWe have developed compiling files for using different libraries.\nThe most simple compilation way is\n$ make\nand it would detect automatically your platform (Darwin or Linux) and your\ntarget SUFIX (mkl, atlas, macports or homebrew). The automatic targets are:\n\nrelease automatic platform and sufix detection target (the same as make\nwithout any argument).\ndebug automatic platform and sufix detection target for debug version.\ntest automatic platform and sufix detection target for test-debug version.\n\nThere are available more targets, just depending in your particular system\ninstallation you can execute them by using $ make TARGET:\n\nrelease-mkl needs of MKL library installed at \/opt\/MKL as prefix.\nrelease-atlas needs of OMP and ATLAS library.\nrelease-no-omp needs ATLAS library.\nrelease-cuda-mkl needs CUDA and MKL installed at \/opt\/MKL as prefix.\nrelease-macports needs Mac OS X with MacPorts and Accelerate Framework.\nrelease-homebrew needs Mac OS X with Homebrew and Accelerate Framework.\n\nBesides this targets, it is possible to compile for debug replacing release\nstring with debug string, and for testing replacing release by\ntest-debug.\nThe makefile has the following variables which can be forced by the user:\n\nPREFIX indicates the prefix for libraries and binaries. In Linux it is\n\/usr, in Darwin it depends on MacPorts (\/opt\/local) or Homebrew\n(\/usr\/local).\nLIB indicates shared library install directory, by default it is\n$(PREFIX)\/lib\nINCLUDE indicates header sources install directory, by default it is\n$(PREFIX)\/include\/april-ann\nLUALIB indicates where Lua library modules are installed, by default it is\n$(PREFIX)\/lib\/lua\/5.2\nLUAMOD indicates where Lua code modules are installed, by default it is\n$(PREFIX)\/share\/lua\/5.2 and there will be created april_tools folder with\na copy of the content of repository's tools folder.\nBIN indicates where you want to install binary files, by default it is\n$(PREFIX)\/bin\n\nEach of this targets will need a little configuration depending on your library\ninstallation. For example, in order to compile with MKL, the file\nprofile_build_scripts\/build_mkl_release.lua contains the following sections\n(among others):\n  global_flags = {\n    debug=\"no\",\n    use_lstrip = \"no\",\n    use_readline=\"yes\",\n    optimization = \"yes\",\n    platform = \"unix\",\n    extra_flags={\n      -- For Intel MKL :)\n      \"-DUSE_MKL\",\n      \"-I\/opt\/MKL\/include\",\n      --------------------\n      \"-march=native\",\n      \"-msse\",\n      \"-DNDEBUG\",\n    },\n    extra_libs={\n      \"-lpthread\",\n      -- For Intel MKL :)\n      \"-L\/opt\/MKL\/lib\",\n      \"-lmkl_intel_lp64\",\n      \"-Wl,--start-group\",\n      \"-lmkl_intel_thread\",\n      \"-lmkl_core\",\n      \"-Wl,--end-group\",\n      \"-liomp5\"\n    },\n  },\n\nYou need to especify the -I option to the compiler, and all the extra_libs\nstuff related with MKL.  Exists one build file for each possible target:\nbuild_release.lua, build_debug.lua, build_mkl_release.lua,\nbuild_mkl_debug.lua, ... and so on.\nThe binary will be generated at bin\/april-ann, which incorporates the Lua 5.2\ninterpreter and works without any dependency in Lua. Besides, a shared library\nand a Lua module will be generated at lib\/libapril-ann.so and\nlib\/aprilann.so, so it is possible to use require from Lua to load APRIL-ANN\nin a standard Lua 5.2 interpreter. In order to require aprilann module it is\nrequired the installation of both libraries in their corresponding place in your\nsystem. Normally this can be done executing $ sudo make install.\nNOTE that loading april-ann as a Lua 5.2 module, you need to have the\n.so library in the package.cpath or LUA_CPATH. It is possible to install it\nin your system defaults following next section.\nENJOY!\nInstallation\nThe installation is done executing:\n$ sudo make install\n\nThis procedure copies the binary to system location in \/usr (or in\n\/opt\/local for Mac OS X via MacPorts). The shared library is copied\nto Lua default directory, in order to load it by using require function.\nIf you are using a non default installation (a custom one), please\ncopy the .so files manually to your package.cpath or LUA_CPATH.\nUse\n\nYou can execute the standalone binary:\n\n$ april-ann\nAPRIL-ANN v0.2.1-beta COMMIT 920  Copyright (C) 2012-2013 DSIC-UPV, CEU-UCH\nThis program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details see LICENSE.txt.\nThis is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\nunder certain conditions; see LICENSE.txt for details.\nLua 5.2.2  Copyright (C) 1994-2013 Lua.org, PUC-Rio\n> print \"Hello World!\"\nHello World!\n\n\nIt is possible to use APRIL-ANN as a Lua module, loading only the packages\nwhich you need (i.e. require(\"aprilann.matrix\")), or loading the full\nlibrary (require(\"aprilann\")).

Leaves in the tree are directories which contain file \"package.lua\".\nThe \"package.lua\" defines requirements, dependencies, libraries, and other stuff needed by the\ncorresponding package.\nEach package could contain this directories:\n\nc_src: source files (.h, .cc, .c, .cpp, .cu, and others).\nbinding: binding files (.lua.cc), a kind of templatized file which generates the glue code between C\/C++ and Lua.\nlua_src: lua source files which define functions, tables, and pseudo-classes in Lua.\ndoc: doxygen documentation additional files.\ntest: examples and files for testing.\n\nAt root directory exists a file named \"package_list.lua\". It is a Lua table with the name of packages that\nyou want to compile.

The build process allows you to remove not needed gestures\nTiny overhead (1649 bytes gzipped by version 1.0)\n\nAvailable events (v. 2.0)\n\ntap\ntaphold\nswipe (all directions)\ntransformstart, transform, transformend (scale and rotation)\n\nComing soon: fancy drag and drop\nUsage\nUse the default jQuery event binding to bind a toe.js event\n$('div.myElem').on('tap', $.noop);\n\nMost of the events support multiple fingers. So if you want to find out the amount of fingers used by a gesture, just look into the TouchList of the original event.\n$('div.myElem').on('tap', function (event) {\n\tvar original = event.originalEvent,\n\t\ttouches = original.touches.length > 0 ? original.touches : original.changedTouches;\n\t\n\tif (touches.length === 2) {\n\t\t\/\/ do something if the user tapped with two fingers\n\t}\n});\n\nDefault eventing behavior will not be influenced by the default toe.js events. So in case you want to catch to a swipe event in a scrollable direction then you have to stop the the default behavior on your own.\n$('div.myElem').on('touchstart touchmove touchend', function (event) {\n\tevent.preventDefault();\n});\n\n$('div.myElem').on('swipe', function (event) {\n\t\n});\n\nHow to extend toe.js? I'll provide a simple template as soon as possible!\nEvents\ntap, doubletap, taphold\nThe \"tap\" event is somehow similar to a click event with a pointer device so there is nothing more to say about it.\n\"taphold\" is triggered if the user starts touching the target and keeps his finger on it for a certain amount of time (default: 500ms)\nswipe\nThe swipe event can be occur in any direction on the element.\n$('div.myElem').on('swipe', function (event) {\n\tif(event.direction === 'up') { \/\/ or right, down, left\n\t\n\t}\n});\n\ntransformstart, transform, transformend\nThis event is also known as pinch event. It allows the user to use two fingers moving away from or towards each other. The user will be able to signalize a scale or rotation of an object. All three events will deliver the center of the pinch, the rotation and the scale.\n$('div.myElem').on('transform', function (event) {\n\tvar center = event.center, \/\/center.pageX and center.pageY\n\t\tscale = event.scale,\n\t\trotation = event.rotation; \/\/in deegres\n\t\n\t\/\/ do sth\n\t\n});\n\nCustom build\nToe.js is a modular library.

Secure fields obscure your input with \u2022's, so others can't read it. Unfortunately, neither can you\u2014you can't tell if you got your password right until you tap \"Log In\".\nChroma-Hash displays a series of colored bars at the end of field inputs so you can instantly see if your password is right. Chroma-Hash takes an MD5 hash of your input and uses that to compute the colors in the visualization. The resulting color pattern is non-reversible, so no one could know what your password just from the colors.\nSee the original web version for a live demonstration, and a bit more explanation.\n\n##Usage\nChromaHashView is a drop in replacement for an EditText for password input.\nRight now you need to import the library to your project, but it will be uploaded to Maven Central shortly.\n##License\nCopyright 2014 Michael Evans\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n   http:\/\/www.apache.org\/licenses\/LICENSE-2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.\n\n","188":"IceFig   \nJava elegant supplement\nJava 8 delivered lambda expressions, but without the enhancement of basic libraries like List, Map, String, which makes\nlambda expression still not delightful.\nInspired by other popular languages like Ruby and Scala, IceFig intends to supply the missing.\nQuick Scan\nElegant alternative to List: Seq\nSeq<Integer> seq = Seqs.newSeq(1,2,3);\nseq.shuffle(); \/\/ copy to a new seq and shuffle it\nseq.forEach((value, idx) -> { \/\/ with index\n    \/\/ (1, 0)  (2, 1)  (3, 2)\n});\nseq.forEachCons(2, (values)->{\n    \/\/ [1,2]  [2, 3]\n});\n\nseq.join(\"-\"); \/\/\"1-2-3\"\n\nseq.map(a -> a+ 1).distinct().reverse().join()\nElegant alternative to Map: Hash\nHash<Integer, Integer> hash = Hashes.<Integer, Integer>newHash().put(1, 2).put(2, 3).put(3, 3);\nhash.containsAny((k, v) -> k+v == 5 ); \/\/true\nhash.keysOf(3); \/\/ [2, 3]\nElegant alternative to String: CharSeq\nCharSeq str = CharSeq.of(\"a b c d e f g\");\nstr.split(\" \").join(\"-\").capitalize(); \/\/\"A-b-c-d-e-f-g\"\nstr.partition(\"d e\").map(CharSeq::trim);  \/\/[\"a b c\", \"d e\", \"f g\"]\nFull Javadoc\nInclude it\n<dependency>\n    <groupId>com.worksap<\/groupId>\n    <artifactId>icefig<\/artifactId>\n    <version>[latest version]<\/version>\n<\/dependency>\nConcept\nNot stream\nIceFig is different from Stream, and implemented without Stream. While, it is simpler concept -- supplement methods on basic libraries.\nStream has several characteristics:\n\nTrends to process each element independently\nInfinite that we can not get the size\nDesigned for large data flow performance\n\nThus, Stream may not be able to support operations related with the size of it, nor operations involving multiple or even random elements.\nBasically, the vast majority operations on List, Map, String don't need a Stream. Stream brings great merits on big data processing, but when we're not facing performance problem (operating a list of about 10x elements), it is an over kill.\nYet Stream brings the 2 additional steps \"Stream()\" and \"collect()\", which is sometimes annoying to write.\nIceFig targets on \"small data\" operations within application logic, to provide simple & beautiful code writing about String, List, Map operation & transformation.\nNo utilities\nIn traditional Java way, we use a lot of utilities (StringUtils, FileUtils) for the missing methods in standard library. While in IceFig, we make an object oriented and functional way to free you from tedious codes.\nZero runtime dependency\nIceFig has no external runtime dependency except JDK 8.\nMutable & default interfaces\nIceFig firstly aggregates all operations which do not change the state into a default interface(e.x. Seq, Hash).\nOn the other hand, there are interfaces named \"mutableXXX\" extending the default ones with additional in-place operations, which are commonly named xxxInPlace.\nIf you don't want the ability to change the object, you can use the default interface to let compiler check it for you. And it is the recommended way.\nNote that the default interface doesn't mean immutability of the object it is on, it only ensures \"if outside only uses this interface on the object, the object will not be changed\".\nConventions\nIceFig uses conventions on method names. If there is a pair of methods name, nameInPlace, method ends with InPlace means calling this method will change the object itself, while calling the other won't.\nLicense\nApache License 2.0\nContribution\nFeel free to submit issues & PRs\n","189":"\u26a0\ufe0f\nTHIS REPO IS DEPRECATED SINCE THE DRAWER LAYOUT WAS INTEGRATED INTO THE TITANIUM CORE.

If you are able to fix bugs or want to add features to the module, please refer to the official module development guide. You can build the module with appc as described there. You can also use grunt build here. For distribution a new version, please update the version number in package.json and run grunt. It will update the version number in manifest and readme.

function detectCharset(buffer), where buffer is an instance of Buffer whose charset should be detected.\nvar charsetDetector = require(\"node-icu-charset-detector\");\n\nvar buffer = fs.readFileSync(\"\/path\/to\/the\/file\");\nvar charset = charsetDetector.detectCharset(buffer);\n\nconsole.log(\"charset name: \" + charset.toString());\nconsole.log(\"language: \" +

properties language and confidence:\n\ncharset.language\n\nlanguage name for the detected character set.\n\n\ncharset.confidence\n\nconfidence of the charset detection for charset.\n\n\n\nLeveraging node-iconv\nSince ICU itself does not have a feature to convert character sets, you may need to use node-iconv (https:\/\/github.com\/bnoordhuis\/node-iconv), which has a powerful character sets converting feature.\nHere is a simple example to leverage node-iconv to convert character sets not supported by Node itself.\nfunction bufferToString(buffer) {\n  var charsetDetector =

The content of your prototype will be scaled to match the size of your browser window.\nWhen viewed on a mobile device, the frame disappears, so your prototype can feel like a real app. As a bonus, Mobile Safari's bouncy scrolling is also prevented automatically.\nSelf-contained. All you need to do is link to a script. No need to bother with additional assets or write code.\nOption to prompt users to add the prototype as an app on their homescreen before using it.\nSwitch between presentation and development mode by pressing Alt + P.\nSwitch between zoom levels with Alt + 1 (100%), Alt + 2 (75%), Alt + 3 (50%), Alt + 4 (25%), Alt + 0 (Fit to Screen). You can also use Alt + - to zoom out and Alt + = to zoom in.\n\nUsage\n\nDownload a template file from templates\/ that matches your needs and place it in your prototype's main directory. Here's the list of all currently available templates:\n\n\niPhone 5s (White, Portrait)\niPhone 5s (White, Landscape)\niPhone 5s (Black, Portrait)\niPhone 5s (Black, Landscape)\niPhone 5s (Gold, Portrait)\niPhone 5s (Gold, Landscape)\niPhone 5c (White, Portrait)\niPhone 5c (White, Landscape)\niPhone 5c (Blue, Portrait)\niPhone 5c (Blue, Landscape)\niPhone 5c (Green, Portrait)\niPhone 5c (Green, Landscape)\niPhone 5c (Red, Portrait)\niPhone 5c (Red, Landscape)\niPhone 5c (Yellow, Portrait)\niPhone 5c (Yellow, Landscape)\niPad Mini (White, Portrait)\niPad Mini (White, Landscape)\niPad Mini (Black, Portrait)\niPad Mini (Black, Landscape)\nNexus 5 (Portrait)\nNexus 5 (Landscape)\nAndroid Wear (Circle)\nAndroid Wear (Square)\n\n\nOpen your index.html in a text editor and link to the template using a <script> tag. The template should be included after the framer.js script:\n\n<script src=\"framer\/framer.js\"><\/script>\n<script src=\"framer\/framerps.js\"><\/script>\n<script src=\"app.js\"><\/script>\n\n<!-- Link to the template script: -->\n<script src=\"iphone-5s-white.js\"><\/script>\n\nLoad index.html in a browser. You should see your prototype appear inside the presentation template.\n\nUsage with Framer Studio\n\n\nDownload one of the templates and place it in the folder of your project, under framer\/.\n\n\nPut this at the top of your script:\n\n\nUtils.domLoadScriptSync('framer\/iphone-5c-blue-landscape.js')\n\nChoose the Fullscreen option in the Preview pane, so you don't get the \"phone in a phone\" effect.\n\nInstalling with Bower\nYou can use bower to install and keep the templates up to date:\nbower install framer-templates\n\nAll of the available templates will be installed to bower_components\/framer-templates\/templates.\nA Note on Compatibility\nThe presentation templates are fully compatible with Framer 3. You can still download the old, Framer 2 compatible version of the templates from here: Download Framer 2 Templates.\nIf you're upgrading from a Framer 2 template, everything should work as expected by just replacing the template file. If you've used the config.template = { ... } syntax to customize the appearance of your template, you should change it to Framer.Config.template = { ... }.\nSetting the Background Image\nThe default background image is a plain off-white color, but if that's not to your tastes, you can use your own by specifying it as a template option before you load the template:\n<script>FramerTemplateConfig = { backgroundImage: '[url to your background image]' };<\/script>\n<script src=\"iphone-5s-white.js\"><\/script>\n\"Add to Homescreen\" Prompt\n\nThe templates have built-in capability for reminding users that view your prototype inside a mobile browser to add it to their homescreen for a more app-like experience. This feature is off by default, but you can turn it on like this:\n<script>FramerTemplateConfig = { shouldShowAddToHomescreenPrompt: true };<\/script>\n<script src=\"iphone-5s-white.js\"><\/script>\nTips\n\nAppend #dev to the URL of your prototype to load it directly in developer mode (no device frame, scaled to 100%). E.g. http:\/\/localhost\/prototype\/index.html#dev\nAppend #z75 to the URL of your prototype to load it at 75% scale. Putting any number after the z will work.  E.g. http:\/\/localhost\/prototype\/index.html#z75\n\nBuilding Your Own Template\nAll templates use the same basic code, but vary in configuration, depending on which device you want to use to present your prototype.\nHere's what the configuration file for the white iPhone template looks like:\n{\n  \"backgroundImage\": \"\",\n  \"shouldShowAddToHomescreenPrompt\": false,\n  \"deviceWidth\": 385,\n  \"deviceHeight\": 805,\n  \"screenWidth\": 320,\n  \"screenHeight\": 568,\n  \"contentWidth\": 640,\n  \"contentHeight\": 1136,\n  \"cursorWidth\": 32,\n  \"promptAnchorTop\": 704,\n  \"promptAnchorLeft\": 320,\n  \"addToHomescreenPromptImage\": \"images\/addtohomescreen-prompt-iphone.png\",\n  \"deviceImage\": \"images\/iphone-5s-white.png\",\n  \"cursorImage1x\": \"\",\n  \"cursorImage2x\": \"\"\n}\nLet's go over the different attributes:\n\n\nbackgroundImage (data URI, URL, or image path) Default: empty\nAn image that will be placed behind the device image.\n\n\npreventBounce (true or false) Default: true\nPrevents the entire page from bouncing when scrolled up\/down (will also prevent scrolling beyond the content boundaries).\n\n\nshouldShowAddToHomescreenPrompt (true or false) Default: false\nSpecifies whether an \"add to homescreen\" prompt should be shown when the prototype is viewed on an iOS device, but not in homescreen standalone app mode.\n\n\ndeviceWidth and deviceHeight (number)\nThe width and height of the device image you're using. Note that the device image is automatically scaled by 50% in order to look crisp and clear on a retina screen, so you'll need to specify the size \/ 2 (e.g. if your image is 2050px, put in 1025 for device width).\n\n\nscreenWidth and screenHeight (number)\nThe size of the actual screen in your device image. For the iPhone background, for example, the size of the screen is 320x568.\n\n\ncontentWidth and contentHeight (number)\nThe size of your actual prototype. This is usually the screen size multiplied by 2. By default, Framer's template assumes that your content is 640px wide (iPhone sized).\n\n\nsidePadding (number) Default: 50\nThe minimum amount of padding (in px) you want to leave between the edges of the browser window and the device image.\n\n\nzoomFactor (number) Default: not set\nA specific zoom factor to use, instead of automatically re-scaling your prototype to fit inside your browser window. A zoom factor of 0.75 would mean 75%, a factor of 2 would mean 200%.\n\n\ncursorWidth (number)\nThe width of the custom cursor image you supplied. This is used to figure out the location of anchor point of the cursor (for circular cursors, for example, this would be the middle of the circle).\n\n\npromptAnchorTop and promptAnchorLeft (number)\nThis is the point in the \"add to homescreen\" prompt image that the arrow points to. You don't have to specify this if you're not using the prompt in the first place.\n\n\naddToHomescreenPromptImage (data URI, URL, or image path)\nThis image will be displayed if the prototype is viewed on a mobile device and not in standalone (homescreen app) mode.\n\n\ndeviceImage (data URI, URL, or image path)\nThis is the device image that will be used to \"hold\" your prototype. Make sure that the actual screen portion of the device is centered perfectly in the image (hint: use one of the existing images for a template).\n\n\ncursorImage1x and cursorImage2x (data URI, URL, or image path) Default: a 66x66 bobble cursor.\nCustom cursor images in normal and retina resolutions.\n\n\ncursorPressedImage1x and cursorPressedImage2x (data URI, URL, or image path) Default: a 66x66 bobble cursor.\nCustom pressed state cursor images in normal and retina resolutions.\n\n\nNote: All image paths are automatically converted to data URIs, so that the template is self-contained.\nTo create your own template, copy one of the config-*.json files, edit the configuration values in there and then run:\nnpm install\ncake build\n\nYou should see something like this:\nclean Cleaning out templates directory...\nbuild Using src\/config-ipad-mini-black.json to generate templates\/ipad-mini-black.js\nbuild Using src\/config-ipad-mini-white.json to generate templates\/ipad-mini-white.js\nbuild Using src\/config-iphone-5c-blue.json to generate templates\/iphone-5c-blue.js\nbuild Using src\/config-iphone-5c-green.json to generate templates\/iphone-5c-green.js\nbuild Using src\/config-iphone-5c-red.json to generate templates\/iphone-5c-red.js\nbuild Using src\/config-iphone-5c-white.json to generate templates\/iphone-5c-white.js\nbuild Using src\/config-iphone-5c-yellow.json to generate templates\/iphone-5c-yellow.js\nbuild Using src\/config-iphone-5s-black.json to generate templates\/iphone-5s-black.js\nbuild Using src\/config-iphone-5s-gold.json to generate templates\/iphone-5s-gold.js\nbuild Using src\/config-iphone-5s-white.json to generate templates\/iphone-5s-white.js\nbuild Using src\/config-nexus-5.json to generate templates\/nexus-5.js\n\nAll done.

We offer version pinning, allowing your project to track major, minor, or patch versions of Node or iojs.\nUsage\nUse any one of our images as a base for your image. We suggest caching your package.json and npm install in layers to reduce build time:\nFROM nodesource\/jessie:0.12.7\n\n# cache package.json and node_modules to speed up builds\nADD package.json package.json\nRUN npm install\n\n# Add your source files\nADD . .\nCMD [\"npm\",\"start\"]\nNotes\n\nNODE_ENV is set to production on these images. If you are using these images for development work, add the line: ENV NODE_ENV dev to your Dockerfile.\n\nImages\nWe offer tags for tracking major and minor releases. These tags enable you to receive either security patches or new features, while avoiding breaking changes.\nNote: some images may not have all tags, if a major\/minor version is not supported on a particular release, these tags will not work.\nFor example, Ubuntu Precise does not have any iojs tags, and Ubuntu Vivid does not have any tags before iojs-1.8.1.\n\nlatest points to the latest release of Node\nLTS points to the latest LTS release of Node\nargon points to the named LTS release of Node\nX points to the latest release of Node X\nX.Y points to the latest release of Node X.Y\niojs points to the latest release of iojs\niojs-X points to the latest minor release of iojs-X\niojs-X.Y points to the latest patch release of iojs-X.Y\n\nDebian-based images\n\nDebian jessie -

There are no guarantees of\nstability, but you are welcome to play around and submit issues\nangular-parse is an AngularJS module for\ninteracting with the Parse REST\nAPI. It does not utlize the Parse\nJavaScript API but instead is built\nfrom (mostly) scratch. The reason is the existing Parse JavaScript API\nis not ideal for AngularJS applications.\nWhy Angular-Parse\nThere are a few things that are not ideal about the existing Parse\nJavaScript API in AngularJS. The existing API is modeled after Backbone\nModels and the main problem is setters\nare used instead of object properties. instance.set('property', 'value')\ndoesn't really fit well with things like ng-model\nInstead, angular-parse is based loosely on Spine\nModels where properties directly\ndefined on the object are used. To facilitate this, when defining a\nmodel, it is \"configured\" by supplying the class name (as defined in\nParse) as well as which properties are part of that class.\nAngular-parse also uses promises for any methods making network calls.\nGetting started\nInclude the JavaScript file\n<!-- Include AngularJS -->\n<script src=\"path\/to\/angular-parse.js\"><\/script>\nMake sure to add \"Parse\" as a dependency of your main module\nvar app = angular.module(\"YourApp\", [\"Parse\"])\nAngular-parse also requires you provide the value \"ParseConfig\" as an\nobject with the following format\napp.config(function (ParseProvider) {\n  ParseProvider.initialize(\"PARSE_APPLICATION_ID\", \"PARSE_REST_API_KEY\");\n});\nDefining Models\nYou can define models by extending Parse.Model. You must call configure\non the class and pass it the Parse class name, and the name of any\nattributes of that class\nUsing CoffeeScript:\napp.factory 'Car', (Parse) ->\n  class Car extends Parse.model\n    @configure \"Car\", \"make\", \"model\", \"year\"\n\n    @customClassMethod: (arg) ->\n      # add custom class methods like this\n\n    customInstanceMethod: (arg) ->\n      # add custom instance methods like this\nUsing JavaScript:\n\/\/ Not implemented yet, sorry\nUsing Models\nA model acts much the same as a normal JavaScript object with a\nconstructor\nCreating a new instance\nYou can create a new instance by using new. Any attributes passed in\nwill be set on the instance. This does not save it to parse, that must\nbe done with .save(). The save method returns a promise, which is\nfulfilled with the instance itself.\nvar car = new Car({\n  make: \"Scion\",\n  model: \"xB\",\n  year: 2008\n});\n\ncar.isNew() === true;\ncar.objectId == null;\n\ncar.save().then(function (_car) {\n  _car === car;\n  car.isNew() === false;\n  car.objectId === \"...aParseId\";\n  car.createdAt === \"...aDateString\";\n  car.updatedAt === \"...aDateString\";\n}\nIf the object has an objectId, it will be updated properly, and will not\ncreate a new instance. save() can be used either for new or existing\nrecords.\nGetting an instance By Id\nThe find method on your model class takes an objectId, and returns a\npromise that will be fulfilled with your instance if it exists.\nCar.find(\"someObjectId\").then(function (car) {\n  car.objectId === \"someObjectId\";\n})\nDestroying an instance\nThe destroy method on an instance will destroy it set destroyed to true\nand set the item's objectId to null\nCar.find(\"someObjectId\").then(function (car) {\n  car.objectId === \"someObjectId\";\n\n  car.destroy().then(function (_car) {\n    car === _car;\n    car.destroyed === true;\n    car.isNew() === true;\n    car.objectId === null;\n  })\n})\nDefining a custom user class\nA simple User class is provided to you. However, you can subclass it:\nangular.module('Parse').factory 'ParseCustomUser', (ParseDefaultUser) ->\n      class CustomUser extends ParseDefaultUser\n        @configure 'users', 'username', 'password', 'property'\nIn this manner, all User instances returned by the Parse methods\nwill be of your custom class.\nContributing\nPull requests and issues are welcome.\n","208":"Screw.Unit is a Behavior-Driven Testing Framework for Javascript. It features nested describes. Its goals are to provide:\n\na DSL for elegant, readable, organized specs;\nan interactive runner that can execute focused specs and describes;\nand brief, extensible source-code.\n\nWhat it is\n\nThe testing language is closure-based. Consider,\ndescribe(\"Matchers\", function() {\n  it(\"invokes the provided matcher on a call to expect\", function() {\n    expect(true).to(equal, true);\n    expect(true).to_not(equal, false);\n  });\n});\n\nA key feature of Screw.Unit are nested describes and the cascading before (and after) behavior that entails:\ndescribe(\"a nested describe\", function() {\n  var invocations = [];\n  \n  before(function() {\n    invocations.push(\"before\");\n  });\n\n  describe(\"a doubly nested describe\", function() {\n    before(function() {\n      invocations.push('inner before');\n    });\n\n    it(\"runs befores in all ancestors prior to an it\", function() {\n      expect(invocations).to(equal, [\"before\", \"inner before\"]);\n    });\n  });\n});\n\nThe Runner\nThe Screw.Unit runner is pretty fancy, supporting focused describes and focused its:\n\nClick on a describe or it to run just those tests.\nGlobal Befores and Afters\nA global before is a before block run before all tests in a test suite, regardless of their nesting. This is often useful to reset global variables, or blank-out DOM nodes before each test is run. Put this at the top of the your suite file or in your spec helper.\nScrew.Unit(function(c) { with(c) {\n  before(function() { ... });\n}});\n\nNote that you can have any number of Screw.Unit(...) blocks in one file. Thus, you can have multiple global befores and afters.\nCustom Matchers\nA custom matcher is a custom assertion specifically tailored to your application. These are helpful in increasing the readability and declarativity of your tests. To create a custom matcher, fill in the blanks for this code:\nScrew.Matchers[\"be_even\"] = {\n  match: function(expected, actual) {\n    return actual % 2 == 0;\n  },\n  failure_message: function(expected, actual, not) {\n    return 'expected ' + $.print(actual) + (not ? ' not' : '') + ' to be even';\n  }\n}\n\nYou can invoke this matcher as follows: expect(2).to(be_even).\nThe Anatomy of Test Infrastructure\nTypical test infrastructure spans multiple files:\n\nA suite.html file that has the necessary html, script tags, and link tags, to include your source code as well as the test infrastructure.\nA spec_helper.js file with global before and after blocks.\nA set of custom matchers.\nYour individual tests.\n\nThe file structure will typically look like:\nspec\/\n  suite.html\n  spec_helper.js\n  matchers\/\n    a_matcher.js\n    another_matcher.js\n  models\/\n    a_spec.js\n    another_spec.js\n  views\/\n    yet_another_spec.js\n\nThe models and views directories are here only for comparison. As a general rule, mirror the file structure of your source code in your spec directory. For example, if you have an MVC application and you organize your source code into models, views, and controllers directories, have parallel directories in your spec\/ directory, with tests for your models, views, and controllers in their respective directories.\nWriting Good Tests\nA great test maximizes these features:\n\nit provides documentation, explaining the intended functioning of the system as well as how the source code works;\nit supports ongoing development, as you bit-by-bit write a failing test and make it pass;\nit supports later refactoring and prevents regression as you add other features;\nand it requires little modification as the implementation of the system changes, especially changes to unrelated code.\n\nThis section focuses principally on tests as documentation. To provide documentation, as well as support future modification, a test should be readable and well organized. Here are some recommendations on how to do just that.\nUse Nested Describes to Express Context\nOften, when you test a system (a function, an object), it behaves differently in different contexts. Use nested describes liberally to express the context under which you make an assertion.\ndescribe(\"Caller#prioritize\", function() {\n  describe(\"when there are two callers in the queue\", function() {\n    describe(\"and one caller has been waiting longer than another\", function() {\n      ...\n    });\n  });\n});\n\nIn addition to using nested describes to express context, use them to organize tests by the structural properties of your source code and programming language. In Javascript this is typically prototype and function. A parent describe for a prototype contains nested describes for each of its methods. If you have cross-cutting concerns (e.g., related behavior that spans across methods or prototypes), use a describe to group them conceptually.\ndescribe(\"Car\", function() {\n  describe(\"#start\", function() {\n  });\n  \n  describe(\"#stop\", function() {\n  });\n  \n  describe(\"callbacks\", function() {\n    describe(\"after_purchase\", function() {\n    });\n  });\n  \n  describe(\"logging\", function() {\n  });\n});\n\nIn this example, one parent describe is used for all Car behavior. There is a describe for each method. Finally, cross-cutting concerns like callbacks and logging are grouped because of their conceptual affinity.\nTest Size\nIndividual tests should be short and sweet. It is sometimes recommended to make only one assertion per test:\nit(\"chooses the caller who has been waiting the longest\", function() {\n  expect(Caller.prioritize()).to(equal, caller_waiting_the_longest);\n});\n\nAccording to some, the ideal test is one line of code. In practice, it may be excessive to divide your tests to be this small. At ten lines of code (or more), a test is difficult to read quickly. Be pragmatic, bearing in mind the aims of testing.\nAlthough one assertion per test is a good rule of thumb, feel free to violate the rule if equal clarity and better terseness is achievable:\nit(\"returns the string representation of the boolean\", function() {\n  expect($.print(true)).to(equal, 'true');\n  expect($.print(false)).to(equal, 'false');\n});\n\nTwo tests would be overkill in this example.\nVariable Naming\nName variables descriptively, especially ones that will become expected values in assertions. caller_waiting_the_longest is better than c1.\nDividing code between tests and befores\nIf there is only one line of setup and it is used in only one test, it may be better to include the setup in the test itself:\nit(\"decrements the man's luck by 5\", function() {\n  var man = new Man({luck: 5});\n  \n  cat.cross_path(man);\n  expect(man.luck()).to(equal, 0);\n});\n\nBut in general, it's nice to keep setup code in before blocks, especially if the setup can be shared across tests.\ndescribe('Man', function() {\n  var man;\n  before(function() {\n    man = new Man({luck: 5});\n  });\n\n  describe('#decrement_luck', function() {\n    it(\"decrements the luck field by the given amount\", function() {\n      man.decrement_luck(3);\n      expect(man.luck()).to(equal, 2)\n    });\n  });\n  ...\n});\n\nPreconditions\nIt is ideal, if there is any chance that your preconditions are non-obvious, to make precondition asserts in your test. The last example, were it more complicated, might be better written:\nit(\"decrements the luck field by the given amount\", function() {\n  expect(man.luck()).to(equal, 5);\n\n  man.decrement_luck(3);\n  expect(man.luck()).to(equal, 2)\n});\n\nWhitespace, as seen here, can be helpful in distinguishing setup and preconditions from the system under test (SUT) and its assertions. It is nice to be consistent in your use of whitespace (e.g., \"always follow a group of preconditions by a newline\"). But it is better to use whitespace as makes the most sense given the context. As with everything in life, do it consciously and deliberately, but change your mind frequently.\nBehavioral Testing\nBehavioral testing, that is, asserting that certain functions are called rather than certain values returned, is best done with closures. The dynamic nature of JavaScript makes mocking frameworks mostly unnecessary.\nit(\"invokes #decrement_luck\", function() {\n  var decrement_luck_was_called = false;\n  man.decrement_luck = function(amount) {\n    decrement_luck_was_called = true;\n  });\n  \n  cat.cross_path(man);\n  expect(decrement_luck_was_called).to(equal, true);\n});\n\nHow to Test the DOM\nThe simplest way to test the DOM is to have a special DOM node in your suite.html file. Have all tests insert nodes into this node; have a global before reset the node between tests.\nIn suite.html:\n<div id=\"dom_test\"><\/div>\n\nIn spec_helper.js:\nScrew.Unit(function() {\n  before(function() {\n    document.getElementById('dom_test').innerHTML = ''; \/\/ but use your favorite JS library here.\n  });\n});\n\nIn some_spec.js:\ndescribe(\"something that manipulates the DOM\", function() {\n  it(\"is effortless to test!\", function() {\n    var dom_test = document.getElementById('dom_test');\n    dom_test.innerHTML = 'awesome';\n    expect(dom_test.innerHTML).to(equal, 'awesome');\n  });\n});\n\nA Javascript library like jQuery, Prototype, or YUI is a essential for testing events.\nImplementation Details\nScrew.Unit is implemented using some fancy metaprogramming learned from the formidable Yehuda Katz. This allows the describe and it functions to not pollute the global namespace. Essentially, we take the source code of your test and wrap it in a with block which provides a new scope:\nvar contents = fn.toString().match(\/^[^\\{]*{((.*\\n*)*)}\/m)[1];\nvar fn = new Function(\"matchers\", \"specifications\",\n  \"with (specifications) { with (matchers) { \" + contents + \" } }\"\n);\n\nfn.call(this, Screw.Matchers, Screw.Specifications);\n\nFurthermore, Screw.Unit is implemented using the Concrete Javascript style, which is made possible by the Effen plugin and jQuery. Concrete Javascript is an alternative to MVC. In Concrete Javascript, DOM objects serve as the model and view simultaneously. The DOM is constructed using semantic (and visual) markup, and behaviors are attached directly to DOM elements. For example,\n$('.describe').fn({\n  parent: function() {\n    return $(this).parent('.describes').parent('.describe');\n  },\n  run: function() {\n    $(this).children('.its').children('.it').fn('run');\n    $(this).children('.describes').children('.describe').fn('run');\n  },\n});\n\nHere two methods (#parent and #run) are attached directly to DOM elements that have class describe. To invoke one of these methods, simply:\n$('.describe').fn('run');\n\nBind behaviors by passing a hash (see the previous example). Using CSS3 selectors and cascading to attach behaviors provides interesting kind of multiple inheritance and polymorphism:\n$('.describe, .it').fn({...}); \/\/ applies to both describe and its\n$('.describe .describe').fn({...}); \/\/ applies to nested describes only\n\nExtensibility\nScrew.Unit is designed from the ground-up to be extensible. For example, to add custom logging, simply subscribe to certain events:\n$('.it')\n  .bind('enqueued', function() {...})\n  .bind('running', function() {...})\n  .bind('passed', function() {...})\n  .bind('failed', function(e, reason) {...})\n\nThere are also events for the loading and loaded test code code, as well as just before and just after all tests are run:\n$(Screw)\n  .bind('loading', function() {...})\n  .bind('loaded', function() {...})\n  .bind('before', function() {...})\n  .bind('after', function() {...})\n\nDownload\nYou can download the source from Github. There is are plenty of examples in the distribution.\nThanks to\n\nNathan Sobo\nYehuda Katz\nBrian Takita\nAman Gupta\nTim Connor\n\n","209":"\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\nThis repository is no longer maintained, please use Shipit instead\n\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\ngrunt-shipit\n\n\n\n\nGrunt plugin for Shipit, an automation engine and a deployment tool written for node \/ iojs.\nIf you prefer using Shipit without grunt, please go to Shipit repository.\nGetting Started\nThis plugin requires Grunt ~0.4.0\nIf you haven't used Grunt before, be sure to check out the Getting Started guide, as it explains how to create a Gruntfile as well as install and use Grunt plugins.

Installing this package is the easiest way to get the full\ndistribution of Armstrong, but is not required to use the various components of\nArmstrong.\n\nGetting Started\n\nInstallation\nFor the latest released version of Armstrong, use pip to install it from\nPyPI like this:\n$ pip install armstrong\n\nThe latest release is 12.03.1.  This is beta software, so please\nkeep that in mind while developing on it.  While we are making every effort to\nmaintain backwards compatibility between releases while in beta, things may\nchange in ways that break your code.\n\nNote on virtualenv\nWe recommend that you use virtualenv to isolate Armstrong.  We highly\nrecommend that you use the --distribute flag when creating a virtual\nenvironment, as that's what we use for testing.  Your results with traditional\nsetuptools may vary.\n\nDevelopment Releases\nYou can track the latest development of Armstrong by installing the development\nversion from Git.  Obtain the latest version by visiting our GitHub page and\neither cloning or downloading a tarball.\nOnce obtained, switch into the directory of the repository (or snapshot if a\ntarball was downloaded) and tell pip to install it:\n$ git clone git:\/\/github.com\/armstrong\/armstrong.git\n... a few lines of output from Git ...\n$ cd armstrong\n$ pip install .\n\n\nCreating an Armstrong project\nTo help get started, the armstrong.cli component can create a basic project\nstructure for you.  Create a new project like this:\n$ armstrong init mysite\narmstrong initialized!\n\nYou can initialize a project using the --template=demo parameter to\ninitialize with a demo SQLite3 database already set up.  This provides a\nworking example of how you can use Armstrong.\n\nArmstrong Project Structure\nThe following files are created in the mysite directory:\n|~fixtures\/\n| |-initial_data.json\n|~requirements\/\n| |-development.txt\n| `-project.txt\n|~settings\/\n| |-__init__.py\n| |-defaults.py\n| |-development.py\n| `-production.py\n|~templates\/\n| `-index.html\n|~urls\/\n| |-__init__.py\n| |-defaults.py\n| |-development.py\n| `-production.py\n|-wsgi.py\n\nThe settings directory contains your Django settings.  The\nsettings.defaults module contains all of the base settings that are common\nto your environment.  settings.development has settings specific to your\ndevelopment environment, while settings.production contains all of your\nproduction settings.\nYou need to edit the settings.development and settings.production to\nconfigure the database engine you want to use.\nYou can also use the settings.local_development and\nsettings.local_production modules to store values that are specific to a\nparticular box.  You shouldn't include these files in your\nrepository---anything that should be shared should go in the appropriate\nsettings module.\nsettings.development and settings.production configure you\nROOT_URLCONF as either urls.development or urls.production,\nrespectively.  Like their settings.* counterparts, you can use these for\nenvironment-specific settings while storing all of your default values in\nurls.defaults.\nAll of your requirements are specified inside the two text files in the\nrequirements directory: development.txt and project.txt.  You can\nuse pip to install the dependencies of your project by providing either file\nas an argument to pip install -r.  development.txt should contain all\nof requirements for your development environment and include project.txt.\nThe project.txt file should contain all of requirements that you have\nto have for your project.\nThe templates directory is configured as the base for your project's\ntemplates.  It contains a simple index.html that is loaded on a request to\n\/ so you can verify that everything is setup correctly.\nThe wsgi.py file provides a basic WSGI module for running your project.  It\nis configured to run using the settings.development settings, so you must\nadjust it prior to running in production.\nNote: You do not have to use the Armstrong project layout.  You can utilize\nall of Armstrong's components inside an existing Django project.  These are\nhere simply to help get you started.\n\nNext Steps\nOnce you have the project created and configured (remember, you need to setup\nyour database just like any other Django project), you've got two final steps.\nFirst, you need to install the requirements file as there are packages that\nArmstrong relies on that need to be installed from GitHub.\n$ cd mysite\n$ pip install -r requirements\/project.txt\n\nAfter you've configured the database engine and installed the base\nrequirements, you're last step is to create the database .  You run armstrong\nsyncdb which initial the database based on the apps listed in your\nINSTALLED_APPS setting.  After this runs, you will have a database created\nby Django (for more information on syncdb, see the Django docs).\nFinally, now that you have all of the dependencies installed and have a\ndatabase, you can test everything out by running armstrong runserver from\ninside your project.  By default, it listens to the localhost on port\n8000.  Loading that up should either give you the Welcome to Armstrong!\npage or the demo site, depending on whether you used the --template=demo\nflag when called armstrong init.\nCongrats, you're now setup and ready to start developing on Armstrong.\n\nVersions\nArmstrong uses date-based versions for this main armstrong package.  The\ncurrent release is 11.09.0.alpha.1.  For more information about how\nversions are handled in Armstrong, see the Versions page on the wiki.\n\nChangelog\n\n12.03.0\nThis updates the various packages to their current stable releases.\n\nDjango 1.4 Support\nArmstrong now supports Django 1.4 and has maintained backwards\ncompatibility with Django 1.3.1.\nArmstrong Wells\nWells now support allow empty wells (you must explicitly opt-in to the\nnew styles), provides abstract models for creating custom well models\nfrom and allows duplication in the admin.\nArmstrong Sections\nSections have undergone numerous small enhancements.  They now have a\nbetter admin, are more signal friendly, and have support for only\nshowing published items.\nArmstrong Layouts\nThe utils.render_model function now boasts configurable backends so\nyou can customize how models are rendered.\nRelated Content\nBackwards Incompatible Changes: The internal representation of\nfields have been changed to better reflect what they should.  A full\nexplanation of all changes is available in the\narmstrong.apps.related_content README.  No database migrations are\nrequired for this new code.\n\n\n11.12.0\nThis updates the various packages to their current release.\n\nArmstrong Hatband\nWe've updated the wells interface inside Hatband to make it more\naccessible.\nArmstrong Images\nWe now include an ImageSet for dealing with, as you might have\nguessed it, sets of Image models.  Thanks for @pizzapanther at\nMouth Watering Media for the contribution.\nImproved Related Content\nWe've added better handling of Related Content, a new admin, and new\nhelper fields for dealing with both sides of a related content\nrelationship.\nArmstrong CLI\nWe've removed the --demo flag in favor of --template=demo\nwhich provides more flexbility going forward.\n\n\n11.09.0\nThis updates the various packages to their current release.  In addition,\nit adds armstrong.hatband and armstrong.core.arm_layout to the\nmix.\n\nArmstrong Hatband\nEvery good hat needs a hatband.  Armstrong's Hatband app is the\nfoundation for our enhancements to Django's built-in admin interface.\nWe've got lots planned for it, but there are a couple of things worth\ncalling out specifically.\n\nIntegration with VisualSearch\nWells now have a much better UI thanks VisualSearch.  This new\nUI allows you to quickly search through all of your models when\nattaching a new Node to a Well.\nRich Text Editor\nWe've added a new RichTextWidget that allows you to easily\nconfigure the rich-text editor of your choice and have all of the\nadmin fields across Armstrong switch to using it.  We're shipping\nwith CKEditor support built-in.\n\n\nNew Demo Data\nNow you can include the --demo parameter to armstrong init to\nuse our demo database.  This includes lorem ipsum articles and some\ndefault sections.\nNew Layout Code\narmstrong.core.arm_layout introduces the {% render_model %}\ntemplate tag which handles switching the template used for rendering\nmodels.\nBackwards Incompatible Changes\n\narmstrong.core.arm_wells had all of its display logic moved to\nthe new armstrong.core.arm_layout app.\nWe've removed primary_section from ContentBase\n\n\n\n\n11.06.0\nThe first generally available release of Armstrong.  It is an unstable,\ndeveloper preview.\n\n\nComponents\nArmstrong is broken down into multiple components.  The main armstrong\npackage installs these individually with each being pinned to a specific\npoint release.\nIncluded in the 11.09 release are the following components:\n\narmstrong.cli\nA command line tool for creating and working with an Armstrong environment.\nYou can use this inside an Armstrong environment as a replacement for the\ntraditional manage.py in Django.\nSee the armstrong.cli repository for more information.\n\narmstrong.core.arm_content\nContains the basic elements for Armstrong-style content.  This does not\nprovide any concrete implementations of models, instead it includes lower\nlevel functionality: fields, mixins, and a base ContentBase for\ncreating a shared content model.\nSee the armstrong.core.arm_content repository for more information.\n\narmstrong.core.arm_layout\nContains helpers for managing the display of data in the context of its\ncurrent layout.\nSee the armstrong.core.arm_layout repository for more information.\n\narmstrong.core.arm_sections\nProvides a system for structuring models into \"sections\" to be used on the\nsite for organizational purposes.\nSee the armstrong.core.arm_sections repository for more information.\n\narmstrong.core.arm_wells\nFunctionality related to \"pinning\" content to a particular area.  Wells\ngive you the ability to specify any collection of models and their order to\ndisplay in various places throughout the site.\nSee the armstrong.core.arm_wells repository for more information.\n\narmstrong.apps.articles\nSimple application for handling basic articles.  This provides a thin layer\non top of the article-specific features found in the arm_content\ncomponent, but will meet the needs of many newsrooms with simple\nrequirements.\nSee the armstrong.apps.articles repository for more information.\n\narmstrong.apps.content\nSimple application for providing a concrete Content model that other\nDjango apps can build off of.\nSee the armstrong.apps.content repository for more information.\n\narmstrong.hatband\nArmstrong's enhanced version of Django's built-in django.contrib.admin\napplication.\nSee the armstrong.hatband repository for more information.\n\n\n\nContributing\nStart by finding the component of Armstrong that you would like to change.  It\nis rare that you will need to start by modifying the main Armstrong repository\nto start.\n\nCreate something awesome -- make the code better, add some functionality,\nwhatever (this is the hardest part).\nFork it\nCreate a topic branch to house your changes\nGet all of your commits in the new topic branch\nSubmit a pull request\n\n\nState of Project\nArmstrong is an open-source news platform that is freely available to any\norganization.  It is the result of a collaboration between the The Texas Tribune\nand The Bay Citizen, and a grant from the John S. and James L. Knight\nFoundation.\nTo follow development, be sure to join the Google Group.\n","211":"\n===========\nMafan - Toolkit for working with Chinese in Python\nMafan is a collection of Python tools for making your life working with Chinese so much less \u9ebb\u70e6 (mafan, i.e. troublesome).\nContained in here is an ever-growing collection of loosely-related tools, broken down into several files. These are:\ninstallation\nInstall through pip:\npip install mafan\n\nencodings\nencodings contains functions for converting files from any number of \u9ebb\u70e6 character encodings to something more sane (utf-8, by default). For example:\nfrom mafan import encoding\n\nfilename = 'ugly_big5.txt' # name or path of file as string\nencoding.convert(filename) # creates a file with name 'ugly_big5_utf-8.txt' in glorious utf-8 encoding\ntext\ntext contains some functions for working with strings. Things like detecting english in a string, whether a string has Chinese punctuation, etc. Check out text.py for all the latest goodness. It also contains a handy wrapper for the jianfan package for converting between simplified and traditional:\n>>> from mafan import simplify, tradify\n>>> string = u'\u8fd9\u662f\u9ebb\u70e6\u5566'\n>>> print tradify(string) # convert string to traditional\n\u9019\u662f\u9ebb\u7169\u5566\n>>> print simplify(tradify(string)) # convert back to simplified\n\u8fd9\u662f\u9ebb\u70e6\u5566\nThe has_punctuation and contains_latin functions are useful for knowing whether you are really dealing with Chinese, or Chinese characters:\n>>> from mafan import text\n>>> text.has_punctuation(u'\u8fd9\u662f\u9ebb\u70e6\u5566') # check for any Chinese punctuation (full-stops, commas, quotation marks, etc)\nFalse\n>>> text.has_punctuation(u'\u8fd9\u662f\u9ebb\u70e6\u5566.')\nFalse\n>>> text.has_punctuation(u'\u8fd9\u662f\u9ebb\u70e6\u5566\u3002')\nTrue\n>>> text.contains_latin(u'\u8fd9\u662f\u9ebb\u70e6\u5566\u3002')\nFalse\n>>> text.contains_latin(u'You are\u9ebb\u70e6\u5566\u3002')\nTrue\nYou can also test whether sentences or documents use simplified characters, traditional characters, both or neither:\n>>> import mafan\n>>> from mafan import text\n>>> text.is_simplified(u'\u8fd9\u662f\u9ebb\u70e6\u5566')\nTrue\n>>> text.is_traditional(u'Hello,\u9019\u662f\u9ebb\u7169\u5566') # ignores non-chinese characters\nTrue\n\n# Or done another way:\n>>> text.identify(u'\u8fd9\u662f\u9ebb\u70e6\u5566') is mafan.SIMPLIFIED\nTrue\n>>> text.identify(u'\u9019\u662f\u9ebb\u7169\u5566') is mafan.TRADITIONAL\nTrue\n>>> text.identify(u'\u8fd9\u662f\u9ebb\u70e6\u5566! \u9019\u662f\u9ebb\u7169\u5566') is mafan.BOTH\nTrue\n>>> text.identify(u'This is so mafan.') is mafan.NEITHER # or None\nTrue\nThe identification functionality is introduced as a very thin wrapper to Thomas Roten's hanzidentifier, which is included as part of mafan.\nAnother function that comes pre-built into Mafan is split_text, which tokenizes Chinese sentences into words:\n>>> from mafan import split_text\n>>> split_text(u\"\u9019\u662f\u9ebb\u7169\u5566\")\n[u'\\u9019', u'\\u662f', u'\\u9ebb\\u7169', u'\\u5566']\n>>> print ' '.join(split_text(u\"\u9019\u662f\u9ebb\u7169\u5566\"))\n\u9019 \u662f \u9ebb\u7169 \u5566\nYou can also optionally pass the boolean include_part_of_speech parameter to get tagged words back:\n>>> split_text(u\"\u9019\u662f\u9ebb\u7169\u5566\", include_part_of_speech=True)\n[(u'\\u9019', 'r'), (u'\\u662f', 'v'), (u'\\u9ebb\\u7169', 'x'), (u'\\u5566', 'y')]\npinyin\npinyin contains functions for working with or converting between pinyin. At the moment, the only function in there is one to convert numbered pinyin to the pinyin with correct tone marks. For example:\n>>> from mafan import pinyin\n>>> print pinyin.decode(\"ni3hao3\")\nn\u01d0h\u01ceo\ntraditional characters\nIf you want to be able to use split_text on traditional characters, you can make use of one of two options:\n\nEither set an environment variable, MAFAN_DICTIONARY_PATH, to the absolute path to a local copy of this dictionary file,\nor install the mafan_traditional convenience package: pip install mafan_traditional. If this package is installed and available, mafan will default to use this extended dictionary file.\n\nContributors:\n\nHerman Schaaf (IronZebra.com) (Author)\nThomas Roten (Github)\nJOEWONGLVFS\nCasper CY Chiang (Github)\n\nAny contributions are very welcome!\nSites using this:\n\nChineseLevel.com\n\n","212":"Detective.io \nDownload \u2022\nFork \u2022\nLicense \u2022\nTest coverage \u2022\nDocumentation \u2022\nVersion 1.12.13 Gorilla\nInstallation\nSee also the full installation guide.\n1.

It is available at http:\/\/github.com\/worldcompany\/djangoembed\/\ngit clone git:\/\/github.com\/worldcompany\/djangoembed\/\ncd djangoembed\npython setup.py install\n\n\nAdding to your Django Project\nAfter installing, adding OEmbed consumption to your projects is a snap.  First,\nadd it to your projects' INSTALLED_APPs and run 'syncdb':\n# settings.py\nINSTALLED_APPS = [\n    ...\n    'oembed'\n]\n\ndjangoembed uses a registration pattern like the admin's.  In order to be\nsure all apps have been loaded, djangoembed should run autodiscover() in the\nurls.py.  If you like, you can place this code right below your admin.autodiscover()\nbits:\n# urls.py\nimport oembed\noembed.autodiscover()\n\n\nConsuming Resources\nNow you're ready to start consuming OEmbed-able objects.  There are a couple of\noptions depending on what you want to do.  The most straightforward way to get\nup-and-running is to add it to your templates:\n{% load oembed_tags %}\n\n{% oembed %}blog.content{% endoembed %}\n\n{# or use the filter #}\n\n{{ blog.content|oembed }}\n\n{# maybe you're working with some dimensional constraints #}\n\n{% oembed \"600x600\" %}blog.content{% endoembed %}\n\n{{ blog.content|oembed:\"600x600\" }}\n\nYou can consume oembed objects in python as well:\nimport oembed\noembed.autodiscover()\n\n# just get the metadata\nresource = oembed.site.embed('http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=nda_OSWeyn8')\nresource.get_data()\n\n{u'author_name': u'botmib',\n u'author_url': u'http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/botmib',\n u'height': 313,\n u'html': u'<object width=\"384\" height=\"313\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/v\/nda_OSWeyn8&fs=1\"><\/param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"><\/param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"><\/param><embed src=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/v\/nda_OSWeyn8&fs=1\" type=\"application\/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"384\" height=\"313\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"><\/embed><\/object>',\n u'provider_name': u'YouTube',\n u'provider_url': u'http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/',\n u'title': u'Leprechaun in Mobile, Alabama',\n u'type': u'video',\n u'version': u'1.0',\n u'width': 384}\n\n# get the metadata and run it through a template for pretty presentation\nfrom oembed.consumer import OEmbedConsumer\nclient = OEmbedConsumer()\nembedded = client.parse_text(\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=nda_OSWeyn8\")\n\n<div class=\"oembed oembed-video provider-youtube\">\n  <object width=\"384\" height=\"313\">\n    <param name=\"movie\" value=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/v\/nda_OSWeyn8&fs=1\"><\/param>\n    <param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"><\/param>\n    <param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"><\/param>\n    <embed src=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/v\/nda_OSWeyn8&fs=1\"\n           type=\"application\/x-shockwave-flash\"\n           width=\"384\"\n           height=\"313\"\n           allowscriptaccess=\"always\"\n           allowfullscreen=\"true\">\n    <\/embed>\n  <\/object>\n  <p class=\"credit\">\n    <a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=nda_OSWeyn8\">Leprechaun in Mobile, Alabama<\/a>\n    by\n    <a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/botmib\">botmib<\/a>\n  <\/p>\n<\/div>'\n\n\nTroubleshooting\nProblem: You try the youtube embed example, but all you get is a link to the youtube video.\nSolution: Djangoembed uses fixtures to load data about oembed providors like Youtube in to the database.  Try fooling around with syncdb (or migrations, if you're running South) until there are objects of type oembed.storedprovider.\nIf you have another problem, consider looking through the more extensive docs in the project's doc subdirectory.\n","215":"ZeroDB server and client-side example of using it\nDocumentation: http:\/\/docs.zerodb.io\/\n","216":"##Hello, this is FileRock Client\nThis is the client of FileRock,\na backup and synchronization service that provides confidentiality and\nchecks the integrity of your data.\nFor instructions about how to run FileRock Client from the source code, look here.\nFor the list of required dependencies, look here.\nRelease notes for FileRock Client are available here.\nIn order to use FileRock Client, you will need a FileRock account.\nYou can get one here.\nIf you don't have an invitation code,\nyou can leave your email address on FileRock landing page,\nand you will receive one as soon as possible.

E.g. if you run\n.\/manage.py test full.dotted.path.to.test_module, it'll run the tests in\nthat module (you can also pass multiple modules). If you give it a single\ndotted path to a package (like a Django app) like .\/manage.py test myapp\nand that package does not itself directly contain any tests, it'll do\ntest discovery in all submodules of that package.\n\nNote\nThis code uses the default unittest2 test discovery behavior, which\nonly searches for tests in files named test*.py. To override this\nsee the TEST_DISCOVER_PATTERN setting or use the --pattern\noption.\n\n\nWhy?\nDjango's own test discovery is very much tied to the directory structure\nof Django apps, partly due to historic reasons (the unittest library\ndidn't have its own discovery for a long time) and prevents Django app\nauthors from being good Python citizens. django-discover-runner uses the\nofficial test discovery feature of the new unittest2 library which is\nincluded in Django.\nBy default there is no way to put project specific tests in a separate\nfolder outside the Python package of the Django project, which is a great\nway to organize your code, separating the tests and non-test code.\ndjango-discover-runner helps you clean up your project tests.\nThere is also no way to specify fully dotted import paths to test\nmodules, functions, class or methods to the test management command\nbut only Django's odd standard <appname>.<TestClassName>.\ndjango-discover-runner allows you to specify any type of label to Django's\ntest management command.\nBy default Django's test runner will execute the tests of Django's own\ncontrib apps, which doesn't make sense if you just want to run your\nown app's or project's tests. django-discover-runner fixes this by allowing\nyou to specify which tests to run and organize your test code outside the\nreach of the Django test runner.\nMore reasons can be found in Carl Meyer's excellent talk about\nTesting and Django (slides).\n\nInstallation\nInstall it with your favorite installer, e.g.:\npip install -U django-discover-runner\n\ndjango-discover-runner requires at least Django 1.4 and also works on 1.5.x.\nStarting in Django 1.6 the discover runner is a built-in.\n\nSetup\n\nTEST_RUNNER (required) needs to point to the DiscoverRunner class\nto enable it:\nTEST_RUNNER = 'discover_runner.DiscoverRunner'\n\n\nAdd 'discover_runner' to your INSTALLED_APPS setting to enable the\nability to override the discovery settings below when using the test\nmanagement command.\n\nTEST_DISCOVER_TOP_LEVEL (optional) should be the directory containing\nyour top-level package(s); in other words, the directory that should be on\nsys.path for your code to import. This is for example the directory\ncontaining manage.py in the new Django 1.4 project layout.\nThe management command option is called --top-level.\n\nTEST_DISCOVER_PATTERN (optional) is the pattern to use when discovering\ntests and defaults to the unittest2 standard test*.py. The management\ncommand option is called --pattern.\n\n\n\nExamples\n\nDjango app\nTo test a reusable Django app it's recommended to add a test_settings.py\nfile to your app package to easily run the app tests with the test\nmanagement command. Simply set the TEST_RUNNER setting to\n'discover_runner.DiscoverRunner', configure the other settings necessary\nto run your tests and call the test management command with the name of\nthe app package, e.g.:\ndjango-admin.py test --settings=myapp.test_settings myapp\n\n\nDjango project\nIf you want to test a project and want to store the project's tests outside\nthe project main package (recommended), you can simply follow the app\ninstructions above, applying it to the \"project\" package, but set a few\nadditional settings to tell the test runner to find the tests:\nfrom os import path\nTEST_DISCOVER_TOP_LEVEL = path.dirname(path.dirname(__file__))\n\nThis would find all the tests within a top-level \"tests\" package. Running the\ntests is as easy as calling:\ndjango-admin.py test --settings=mysite.test_settings tests\n\nAlternatively you can specify the --top-level-directory management\ncommand option.\n\nMultiple Django versions\nIn case you want to test your app on older Django versions as well as\nDjango >= 1.6 you can simply conditionally configure the test runner in your\ntest settings, e.g.:\nimport django\n\nif django.VERSION[:2] < (1, 6):\n  TEST_RUNNER = 'discover_runner.DiscoverRunner'\n\n\nChangelog\n\n1.0 06\/15\/2013\n\nGOOD NEWS! This runner was added to Django 1.6 as the new default!\nThis version backports that runner for Django 1.4.x and 1.5.x.\nRemoved TEST_DISCOVER_ROOT setting in favor of unittest2's own way to\nfigure out the root.\nDropped support for Django 1.3.x.\n\n\n0.4 04\/12\/2013\n\nAdded ability to override the discover settings with a custom test management\ncommand.\n\n\n0.3 01\/28\/2013\n\nFixed setup.py to work on Python 3. This should make this app compatible\nto Python 3.\n\n\n0.2.2 09\/04\/2012\n\nStopped setting the top level variable in the case of using a module path\nas the test label as it made the wrong assumption that the parent directory\nis the top level.\n\n\n0.2.1 08\/20\/2012\n\nFixed a rather esoteric bug with testing test case class methods\nthat was caused by a wrong import and the way Django wraps itself\naround the unittest2 module (if availale) or unittest on Python >= 2.7.\n\n\n0.2 05\/26\/2012\n\nAdded ability to use an optionally installed unittest2 library\nfor Django projects using Django < 1.3 (which added unittest2 to the\ndjango.utils.unittest package).\n\n\n0.1.1 05\/23\/2012\n\nFixed a bug that prevented the project based feature to work correctly.\n\n\n0.1 05\/20\/2012\n\nInitial release with support for Django >= 1.3.\n\n\nThanks\nThis test runner is a humble rip-off of Carl Meyer's DiscoveryRunner\nwhich he published as a gist a while ago. All praise should be directed at\nhim. Thanks, Carl!\nThis was also very much related to ticket #17365 which eventually led\nto the replacement of the default test runner in Django.

This allows VertX developers to use the RxJava type-safe composable API to build VertX verticles.\nDependencies\n\nThe module wraps the VertX core objects to add Observable support so it is tightly bound to the VertX release.\nThis module also contains the Netflix RxJava library.\n\nStatus\nCurrently Observable wrappers are provided for\n\nEventBus\nHttpServer\nHttpClient\nNetServer\nNetClient\nTimer\n\nThere are also base Observable adapters that map Handler and AsyncResultHandler to Observable that can be used to call other Handler based APIs.\nSupport coming soon for\n\nFileSystem\nSockJSServer\n\nUsage\nThis is a non-runnable module, which means you add it to your module via the \"includes\" attribute of mod.json.\nAll standard API methods of the form\nvoid method(args...,Handler<T> handler)\nare typically available in the form\nObservable<T> method(args...)\nwhere the operation is executed immediately or\nObservable<T> observeMethod(args...)\nwhere the operation is executed on subscribe. This latter form is the more 'pure' Rx method and should be used where possible (required to maintain semantics of concat eg)\nEventBus\nRxEventBus rxEventBus = new RxEventBus(vertx.eventBus());\nrxEventBus.<String>registerHandler(\"foo\").subscribe(new Action1<RxMessage<String>>() {\n  public void call(RxMessage<String> message) {\n    \/\/ Send a single reply\n    message.reply(\"pong!\");\n  }\n});\n\nObservable<RxMessage<String>> obs = rxEventBus.send(\"foo\", \"ping!\");\n\nobs.subscribe(\n  new Action1<RxMessage<String>>() {\n    public void call(RxMessage<String> message) {\n      \/\/ Handle response \n    }\n  },\n  new Action1<Throwable>() {\n    public void call(Throwable err) {\n     \/\/ Handle error\n    }\n  }\n);\n\nScheduler\nThe standard RxJava schedulers are not compatible with VertX. In order to preserve the Vert.x Threading Model all callbacks to a Verticle must be made in the context of that Verticle instance.\nRxVertx provides a custom Scheduler implementation that uses the Verticle context to scheduler timers and ensure callbacks run on the correct context.\nIn the following example the scheduler is used to run a Timer and then buffer the output.\nNote: The RxVertx scheduler must always be used to observe results inside the Verticle. It is possible to use the other Schedulers (eg for blocking calls) as long as you always use observeOn to route the callbacks onto the Verticle EventLoop. For timers it is more efficient to just use the Vert.x scheduler\nRxVertx rx = new RxVertx(vertx);\nObservable o = (some observable source)\n\nObservable\n      .timer(10, 10, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS, rx.contextScheduler())\n      .buffer(100,TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS,rx.contextScheduler())\n      .take(10)\n      .subscribe(...)\nTimer\nThe timer functions are provided via the RxVertx wrapper. The timer is set on-subscribe. To cancel a timer that has not first, or a periodic timer, just unsubscribe.\nRxVertx rx = new RxVertx(vertx);\nrx.setTimer(100).subscribe(new Action1<Long>() {\n  public void call(Long t) {\n    \/\/ Timer fired\n  }\n});\nThe new Scheduler means you can use the native RxJava Timer methods - this Timer may be deprecated in future\nHelper\nThe support class RxSupport provides several helper methods for some standard tasks\nStreams\nThere are two primary wrappers\nObservable RxSupport.toObservable(ReadStream)\nConvert a ReadStream into an Observable<Buffer>\nRxSupport.stream(Observable,WriteStream)\nStream the output of an Observable to a WriteStream.\nplease note that this method does not handle writeQueueFull so cannot be used as a pump\n","226":"Android Autowire\nUsing Java Annotations and Reflection, this library will allow you to replace some of annoying boilerplate setup from your Activities, Fragments, and Views with an annotation based approach.\nThis repository is referenced in the blog post: http:\/\/www.cardinalsolutions.com\/cardinal\/blog\/mobile\/2014\/01\/dealing_with_android.html\nFeatures\n\nSupports Inheritance of Activities. You can inherit views from parent Activities, and every view will be picked up and wired in\nAs it uses reflection, it will work with private variables\nComes with several out of the box ways of specifying IDs allowing for flexibility in naming IDs and implementing the annotations\nProvides an optional required field in the annotation, so if an ID is not found, the variable will be skipped without an Exception being thrown\nSupport Annotations for Layout as well as Views\nSupport an Annotation based approach for saving instance state.  This also allows for inheritance.\nCan be adapted to work with Fragments as well as Activities\nCan be adapted to work with CustomViews\n\nThe Android Way\nHere are some Examples of Android Boilerplate code that we can make more clear, readable, and easier to use with Annotations.\nfindViewById()\nOne particularly jarring example of Android boilerplate code is the findViewById() method.  Every time you want to access an Android view defined in your XML, you need to use this method, often with a typecast.  For large Activities with many views, this can add a lot of code that does nothing but pull variables out of the xml.\npublic class MainActivity extends BaseActivity{\n\n\tprivate ImageView logo;\n\n\t@Override\n    public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState){\n        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\n        setContentView(R.layout.main);\n\n    \tlogo = (ImageView) findViewById(R.id.logo);\n\t}\n}\nsetContentView()\nIn the code example above, we have the setContentView(R.layout.main) line.  You need something like this in every Activity class, with the sole purpose of inflating your layout.  It's not a big deal, but it is one extra step you have to go through when creating your Activity classes because it has to be put in exactly the right spot.  It needs to be in onCreate() before any findViewById() call.\nSaving Instance State\nA quirk of how the Android operating systems works, Activities can be destroyed at almost anytime to make room for other OS processes.  They are also destroyed and re-created on rotation.  The developer is in charge of saving the Activity's state, making sure the Activity comes back exactly the same way before it was destroyed.\nIn the Android way, instance variables that you have to manually store are put into a Bundle in the onSaveInstanceState method.  Then they must be pulled out again in the onCreate() method.\npublic class MainActivity extends BaseActivity{\n\n    private static final String SOME_STATE_KEY = \"some_state_key\";\n\tprivate int someState;\n\n\t@Override\n    public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState){\n        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\n        setContentView(R.layout.main);\n\n    \tif(savedInstanceState != null){\n              someState = savedInstanceState.getInt(SOME_STATE_KEY);\n        }\n\t}\n\n    @Override\n    protected void onSaveInstanceState(Bundle outState){\n\t\tsuper.onSaveInstanceState(outState);\n        outState.putInt(SOME_STATE_KEY, someState);    \n    }\n}\nWith AndroidAutowire\nThis library will help streamline this process into a more readable format using annotations and reflection.\nfindViewById()\nBy annotating a class variable for the View with the @AndroidView custom annotation, you enable the reflection code to pull the view out of the xml.  The variable name will be the view id, or alternatively, the view id can be specified in the annotation.  The annotation processing occurs in an overridden method of setContentView(int layoutResID) in the Activity\u2019s base class.\nMainActivity Class\npublic class MainActivity extends BaseActivity{\n\n\t@AndroidView\n\tprivate ImageView logo;\n\n\t@Override\n    public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState){\n        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\n        setContentView(R.layout.main);\n\t}\n}\nBaseActivity class\npublic class BaseActivity extends Activity {\n\n\t@Override\n    public void setContentView(int layoutResID) {\n    \tsuper.setContentView(layoutResID);\n    \tAndroidAutowire.autowire(this, BaseActivity.class);\n    }\n}\nsetContentView()\nSpecifying the layout resource in the onCreate is not difficult, but it can create problems if you forget add the method call, or if you do it out of order.  Instead, use an annotation:\nMainActivity Class\n@AndroidLayout(R.layout.main)\npublic class MainActivity extends BaseActivity{\n\n\t@Override\n    public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState){\n        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\n\t}\n}\nBaseActivity class\npublic class BaseActivity extends Activity {\n\n    @Override\n    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState){\n        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\n        int layoutId = AndroidAutowire.getLayoutResourceByAnnotation(this, this, BaseActivity.class);\n\t\t\/\/If this activity is not annotated with AndroidLayout, do nothing\n\t\tif(layoutId == 0){\n\t\t\treturn;\n\t\t}\n\t\tsetContentView(layoutId);\n    }\n\n\t@Override\n    public void setContentView(int layoutResID) {\n    \tsuper.setContentView(layoutResID);\n    \tAndroidAutowire.autowire(this, BaseActivity.class);\n    }\n}\nSaving Instance State\nAll of the reading\/writing with the Bundle can be done with reflection.  Simply annotate the instance variable you want to save\/load, and the AndroidAutowire library will do the work for you.\nMainActivity Class\n@AndroidLayout(R.layout.main)\npublic class MainActivity extends BaseActivity{\n    @SaveInstance\n    private int someState;\n\n\t@Override\n    public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState){\n        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\n\t}\n}\nBaseActivity Class\npublic class BaseActivity extends Activity {\n\n    @Override\n    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState){\n        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\n        AndroidAutowire.loadFieldsFromBundle(savedInstanceState, this, BaseActivity.class);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n\tprotected void onSaveInstanceState(Bundle outState){\n\t\tsuper.onSaveInstanceState(outState);\n\t\tAndroidAutowire.saveFieldsToBundle(outState, this, BaseActivity.class);\n\t}\n}\nConfiguration\nSimply include the jar in your classpath.  The process for including the AndroidAutowire library will be IDE specific, but once the library is included in the project, the methods will all be there for you to use.\nYou can create your own BaseActivity using the process above, or you can use a provided BaseActivity called BaseAutowireActivity.  That will provide support for all features given above, as well as including a new abstract method that acts as a callback once the autowiring is complete. If you use features like BaseAutowireActivity and @AndroidLayout it may not even be necessary to override onCreate in your Activity class.\nFragments\nMuch like Activities, Fragments have layouts, state to be saved, and views to be autowired. But the process for setting up a Fragment is different than an Activity.  None the less, AndroidAutowire provides the ability to do all of this using Annotations as well by providing a new method: AndroidAutowire.autowireFragment().\nHere is an Example base class for Fragments:\npublic abstract class BaseFragment extends Fragment {\n\n\tprotected View contentView;\n\t\n\t@Override\n    public View onCreateView(LayoutInflater inflater, ViewGroup container, Bundle savedInstanceState) {\n\t\t\/\/Load any annotated fields from the bundle\n\t\tAndroidAutowire.loadFieldsFromBundle(savedInstanceState, this, BaseFragment.class);\n\t\t\n\t\t\/\/Load the content view using the AndroidLayout annotation\n        contentView = super.onCreateView(inflater, container, savedInstanceState);\n        if (contentView == null) {\n        \tint layoutResource = AndroidAutowire.getLayoutResourceByAnnotation(this, getActivity(), BaseFragment.class);\n        \tif(layoutResource == 0){\n            \treturn null;\n            }\n        \tcontentView = inflater.inflate(layoutResource, container, false);\n        }\n        \/\/If we have the content view, autowire the Fragment's views\n        autowireViews(contentView);\n        \/\/Callback for when autowiring is complete\n        afterAutowire(savedInstanceState);\n        return contentView;\n    }\n\t\n\tprotected void autowireViews(View contentView){\n\t\tAndroidAutowire.autowireFragment(this, BaseFragment.class, contentView, getActivity());\n\t}\n\t\n\t@Override\n\tpublic void onSaveInstanceState(Bundle outState){\n\t\tsuper.onSaveInstanceState(outState);\n\t\tAndroidAutowire.saveFieldsToBundle(outState, this, BaseFragment.class);\n\t}\n\t\n\tprotected abstract void afterAutowire(Bundle savedInstanceState);\n}\nUnfortunately, do to fragmentation between the Android Core API and the Support Library, this class is not included with the Jar (whereas BaseAutowireActivity is included).\nCustom Views\nIf you are writing a non-trivial Android App, chances are you will need to make your own custom Views at some point.  These views may have subviews.  Again, rather than being forced to use findViewById(), we can use AndroidAutowire and Annotations with the AndroidAutowire.autowireView() method.\npublic class CustomView extends RelativeLayout {\n\n\t@AndroidView(R.id.title)\n\tprivate TextView title;\n\t\n\t@AndroidView(R.id.icon)\n\tprivate ImageView icon;\n\n    public CustomView(Context context, AttributeSet attrs, int defStyle) {\n\t\tsuper(context, attrs, defStyle);\n\t\tLayoutInflater inflater = LayoutInflater.from(context);\n\t\tinflater.inflate(R.layout.custome_view, this);\n\t\tAndroidAutowire.autowireView(this, CustomView.class, context);\n\t}\n}\nComparison to Other Libraries\nThere are some other open source libraries that accomplish something similar to what Android Autowire hopes to provide\nRoboGuice is a dependency injection library that can inject views in much the same way.  However, you must extend the Robo* classes, and there may be performance issues. (https:\/\/github.com\/roboguice\/roboguice\/wiki)\nAndroid Annotations can wire in views by annotation, but the approach they take is quite different.  Android Annotations requires you to use an extra compile step, creating generated Activity classes that must be referenced in the AndroidManifest.xml.  As this approach will create subclasses of your Activity, you cannot use this on private variables.  Additionally, there is much more configuration and initial setup. (https:\/\/github.com\/excilys\/androidannotations\/wiki)\nButter Knife does the same compile time annotation approach as Android Annotations, but instead of generating a new Activity, they generate a class to pass your activity into. This way, you don't have to deal with generated sub classes, but you still get some of the heavy hitting features like onClick Listeners. (http:\/\/jakewharton.github.io\/butterknife\/)\nThe real advantage to this \"Android Autowire\" library is ease of use.  There is minimal configuration in just about every IDE, and little overhead, allowing you to quickly start using these annotations in your new or existing project.  Instead of providing a full feature set, this library concentrates only on limited number of features, such as views, layouts and Bundle resources, allowing it to fill the gap while still being lightweight.\nPerformance\nThe more you use the library, the more you want to keep an eye out for performance hits. Most of this reflection code is going to be done on the main thread, and that is always a risk. However, I have been using all of the features, from loading Serializable objects from the Bundle to finding views inside of Fragments, and I have not noticed any type of performance decrease. In fact, even some very complex Activities have made full use of this reflection code without any issue. My biggest concern would be older devices that I have not tested on, devices that may be slow to begin with.\nTo illustrate this, I did some benchmarks on an HTC Nexus One running 2.3.4 Gingerbread. The application I used is a fairly complex production Android App. The time is the total time for the reflection to complete, not including the time it takes for the system to start the Activity\/Fragment and not including any time to inflate XML layouts.\n\nActivity wiht 1 Autowired View, 0 Save Instance variables, and layout: 0.7ms\nActivity with 15 Autowired Views, 2 Save Instance variables, and layout: 4.9ms\nFragment with 1 Autowired View, 0 Save Instance variables, and layout: 2.0ms\nFragment with 3 Autowired Views, 4 Save Instance variables, and layout: 6.5ms\nFragment with 18 Autowired Views, 6 Save Instance variables, layout, and inheritance: 44.6ms\n\nThis is hardly a scientific endeavour, but it should give some pretty clear direction as to what the performance impact of using this library would be. Using this library with API level 10 and up seems to be fairly safe, as the most complicated bit of reflection using a Fragment with many views and instance state was still completed in less than 50 milliseconds.\nAuthor \/ License\nCopyright Cardinal Solutions 2015.

They are laid out in an 8 \u00d7 8 grid as described by the table above.

These coefficients are synthesized at a resolution of 2n \u00d7 2n, and re-analyzed up to degree n. The round trip time is measured, and the output frequency coefficients are compared with one, giving root-mean-square error and maximum error. Upon completion, a table of results in printed to stdout including\n\nthe degree n,\nthe run time in seconds,\nthe RMS error,\nthe log2 RMS error,\nthe maximum absolute error, and\nthe log2 maximum absolute error.\n\nThe log2 results indicate the number of bits to which the output agrees with the input, thus quantifying the numerical stability of synthesis together with analysis. Several runs of this tool are graphed below.\nAPI\nEach of these tools uses a spherical harmonic transformation template library given in the file sh.hpp. Templating allows the transform to be calculated using float, double, or long double built-in types. User-defined types are even supported if they overload the basic arithmetic operators and include a few of the functions of the math library.\n\n\nsht<real>::sht(int n, int c)\nConstruct a spherical harmonic transform object. All internal computation will be performed using the real type. The frequency domain representation has order n the spatial domain representation has order 2n \u00d7 2n. c gives the number of channels of both.\n\n\nThis object has public attributes for input and output. S is a 2n \u00d7 2n spatial domain image with c channels of type real. F is an n \u00d7 n frequency domain image with c channels of type real. These images overload the function operator allowing direct access to their contents.\n\n\nreal& Flm<real>::operator()(int l, int m, int k)\nGive a reference to the frequency sample at degree l, order m, and channel k suitable for reading or writing.\n\n\nreal& Sij<real>::operator()(int i, int j, int k)\nGive a reference to the spatial sample at row i, column j, and channel k suitable for reading or writing.\n\n\nWith either the spatial domain or frequency domain image set, analysis or synthesis may be performed.\n\n\nvoid sht<real>::ana()\nPerform a spherical harmonic analysis of S giving F.\n\n\nvoid sht<real>::syn()\nPerform a spherical harmonic synthesis of F giving S.\n\n\nWhen performing image IO, both S and F support bulk transfer functions that automatically cast to and from the internal floating point type to 32-bit floating point.\n\n\nvoid Flm<real>::set(const float *data, int N)\nvoid Flm<real>::get(float *data, int N)\nTransfer 32-bit floating point data into or out of the frequency domain image. The data argument must accomodate N \u00d7 N \u00d7 c 32-bit floats. N need not be a power of two, and when N does not equal n then a truncated set of coefficients is accepted or provided.\n\n\nvoid Sij<real>::set(const float *src)\nvoid Sij<real>::get(float *dst)\nTransfer 32-bit floating point data into or out of the spatial domain image. The data buffer must accommodate 2n \u00d7 2n \u00d7 c 32-bit floats.\n\n\nIn both cases, passing a null pointer to the set function initializes the contents of the buffer to zero.\nExamples\nThis segment of code shows the basic usage of the API for analysis. A square source image with power-of-two size is read from a file and a floating point destination buffer is allocated. A double precision SHT object is instanced with the desired degree and image parameters supplied to the constructor. The spatial domain input is set and the analysis is performed. Finally, the frequency domain output is acquired and written to a file. Synthesis is similar.\nsrc = image_read_float(\"input.tif\", &w, &h, &c, &b);\n\nn = w \/ 2;\n\ndst = (float *) calloc(n * n * c, sizeof (float);\n\nsht<double> T(n, c);\n\nT.S.set(src);\nT.ana();\nT.F.get(dst);\n\nimage_write_float(\"output.tif\", n, n, c, b, dst);\n\nEnvironment Mapping\nThe following examples demonstrate the application of the spherical harmonic tools to real-time environment mapping. We begin with this 32-bit floating-point 512 \u00d7 512 spherical panorama of a St. Peter's Basilica, one of several de facto standard light probes provided by Paul Debevec, unwrapped and resampled using envtools.\n\nIt's a common practice to map such an image onto a model to generate the appearance of a reflective mirror finish...\n\nor a refractive glass material with magnifying effects and more subtle reflections. Here, let me hold that up to the light for you.\n\nApplying the spherical harmonic transform to the cathedral image allows us to generalize the appearance of such materials through manipulation in the frequency domain. To begin, the image is analyzed at n=512 giving a 32-bit 256 \u00d7 256 floating point frequency domain image.\nshtrans -o st-peters-sht.tif st-peters.tif\n\nThe output looks like this.\n\nWe can achieve some interesting material effects by removing some of the high-frequency harmonics from it. However, this must be done carefully. To simply crop the frequency domain image at the upper left would corrupt the synthesis with ringing artifacts. Instead, use the -g option to apply a Gaussian filter window with a width of 64.\nshtrans -g64 -o st-peters-sht-g64.tif st-peters.tif\n\nHere's the result.\n\nSynthesize this result...\nshtrans -i -o st-peters-g64.tif st-peters-sht-g64.tif\n\ngiving this image.\n\nIt's a blurry cathedral. Critically, however, this is not a simple 2D blur like that produced by a Photoshop filter. Instead, it behaves as though the blur radius were uniform at every point on the sphere, including the poles. In contrast, a 2D blur of a spherical image would behave as if the blur became increasingly thin toward the poles, producing unsightly artifacts there.\nApplying the blurred image to the model shows an imperfect reflection and a frosted refraction, giving a much more natural and realistic material. In addition, all of these images use the width-64 blurred image as a backdrop, giving the appearance of shallow focus regardless of view direction.\n\n\nWe can take this a step further. Here we apply a Gaussian filter with a width of 32.\nshtrans -g32 -o st-peters-sht-g32.tif st-peters.tif\n\nThere's a lot less information in the frequency domain.\n\nTherefore there's much more blur in the spatial domain. With only 32 degrees of spherical harmonics, only the very low frequencies remain.\nshtrans -i -o st-peters-g32.tif st-peters-sht-g64.tif\n\n\nThe resulting reflection no longer resembles chrome, and instead takes on the character of pewter or brushed aluminum. In the pinkish glow of St. Peter's Basilica, it almost looks like copper. In comparison, the perfect reflection provided by the original unfiltered environment map looks downright fake.\n\nThe refractive effect is that of diffuse or frosted glass.\n\nDiffuse Convolution\nThese are all specular illumination effects, but the spherical harmonic transform provides a means to extend environment mapping into diffuse illumination, as described by Ramamoorthi and Hanrahan in their 2001 SIGGRAPH paper An Efficient Representation for Irradiance Environment Maps. In this work, Ramamoorthi and Hanrahan note that diffuse illumination is essentially convolution with a cosine-weighted hemisphere, and demonstrate that the resulting irradiance need be represented using only three degrees of spherical harmonics.\nWe can apply the diffuse convolution using the -d option.\nshtrans -d -o st-peters-sht-dif.tif sh-peters.tif\n\nIndeed, only the top-left 3 \u00d7 3 block of pixels contains much data. There are a few dim pixels elsewhere, but the literature demonstrates that eliminating these will result in an average error of at most 3%.\n\nThere's so little information here that we could validly crop that image down to 4 \u00d7 4 (a power of two), resulting in an 8 \u00d7 8 synthesis with no significant loss of information. But for the sake of consistency with the other examples...\nshtrans -i -o st-peters-dif.tif sh-peters-sht-dif.tif\n\nThe resulting irradiance environment map is not just very heavily blurred, it actually gives a weighted sum of every input pixel visible at every possible orientation. The sphere map represents the total light falling upon every point on a sphere from every direction. In this example, St. Peter's is well lit from above, and diffuse reflection of the marble gives a pink ambient glow.\n\nWhen rendering, a single texture reference is made along the object normal. This returns a value equivalent to the usual diffuse lighting calculation, but done for every light source in the room simultaneously. The resulting material is a perfectly matte white, like unglazed ceramic.\n\nCombining this with one of the reflection maps above gives a specular effect, like glazed ceramic, the material of the original Utah teapot.\n\nOf course, color and gloss texture maps and normal maps can be combined with these blurred and convolved environment maps, giving very rich and extremely realistic materials.\nHere's a summary image giving all of the examples together. Click to enlarge.\n\nFilter Selection\nThe choice of filter is an important one. Ringing artifacts will always arise from a spherical harmonic synthesis with an equirectangular projection. This is because the equirectangular projection badly matches the true distribution of information on the sphere. In particular, the spatial resolution near the poles is far higher than near the equator, so any reasonable set of spherical harmonic coefficients will be band-limited at high latitude. The available filters will handle different types of images with varying levels of success. The following examples are intended to help clarify this, but ultimately, experience gained through trial and error are most valuable.\nThe three filter windows are graphed here for n=256. The Gauss window, in red, has the familiar shape of the bell curve, dropping off rapidly and approaching zero smoothly. The Hann (a.k.a. Hanning) window, in green, is a cosine wave with equal balance. The Lanczos window (in blue) is the first lobe of the sinc function, dropping off slowly and meeting zero abruptly.\n\nWhen the filter width is less than n, the Gauss and Hann windows still clamp out at zero. However, the Lanczos window will oscillate about zero as one would expect from the sync function.\nThe following example uses a 512 \u00d7 512 image of a 16 \u00d7 16 black-white checker pattern. With its high contrast, it represents a worst-case scenario for 8-bit images, and will demonstrate the best choice for round-trip frequency-domain operations upon common spherical images.\nThe checker input is analyzed and re-synthesized four times. Image A shows the center of the input, which covers the equator where the spherical harmonics match the information density in the image well. Image B shows a synthesis of an unfiltered set of coefficients. The ringing is obvious even in this easy area. Images C, D, and E shows the Gauss, Hann, and Lanczos filters, with each sharper than the last.\n\nHere is the same set of images, showing instead a portion of the checker pattern in the troublesome region near the north pole. Image B, with no filtering, is dominated by ringing artifacts. The Gauss, Hann, and Lanczos filters are, again, increasingly sharp. Ringing is generally under control, though slightly apparent in the Lanczos image when magnified.\n\nWe can infer from this that some form of filtering is necessary. The Lanczos filter preserves the sharpness in the input best, and is probably the go-to choice when doing frequency-domain manipulations of spherical data sets. Blurring is expected and usually even desirable near the poles, especially if the filtered output is to be mapped onto a sphere for real-time texture mapping. Under such circumstances the Gauss filter might produce the most visually appealing results.\nThings change when we shift to high dynamic range inputs, such as the light probe of St. Peter's Basilica used in the teapot renderings, above. The following images show the results of each filter applied with a width of 32, cropped at top of the image.\n\nThe Gauss filtering in image A gives a nice, smooth blur. The Hann window, image B, does not handle extremely bright light sources well at all, and produces a severe overshoot. The Lanczos window, image C, produces a surprising kind of bokeh effect with high-frequency ringing produced by the many lobes of the tail of the sinc. It's interesting, but not what we're looking for. For high dynamic range light probes, stick with Gauss.\nIn general, there will always be a trade-off between sharpness and ringing. The type of the data and its intended usage will determine how this trade-off is best made.\nTests\nConformance\nAs a basic eye-ball level test of conformance, the shtrans tool was used to synthesize the EGM 2008 data set, the Earth Gravitational Model consisting of 2190 degrees of spherical harmonic coefficients. The 8192 \u00d7 8192 grayscale output was gradient-mapped using GIGO and scaled down using Photoshop. It matches.\n\nPrecision\nThe sherror tool tests the numerical precision of the spherical harmonic transform implementation by synthesizing and re-analyzing white noise. The task is performed at degrees from n= 21 to 212 using single, double, and long double precision floating point values. The output is compared with the input and the degree to which the two match is quantified.\nThe software was compiled for OSX 10.8 using g++ 4.7.2. The test hardware used 2 \u00d7 2.0 GHz eight-core Intel Xeon E5 processors. Data shown here was collected using 16 OpenMP threads.\nHere are the round trip times, with time in seconds plotted on a log-10 scale. Single precision floating point performance is shown in red, double in green, and long double in blue. G++'s long double is in fact an Intel-native 80-bit float, which is the same type that implements single and double precision calculation, so performance parity is not a big surprise. Their stored size varies though, so these results would indicate that the process is not cache-bound on this hardware. The computation is effectively instantaneous when n is smaller than 6 and the resolution of the timer was not sufficient to demonstrate any distinction.\n\nHere we see the agreement between the input and the round trip output. Specifically, this graph shows the average number of bits to which each pair of values coincides, as given by the base-2 log of their root-mean-square difference. Single precision floating point (in red) gives at most 24 bits of useful precision and sees a precipitous drop in stability past n=24, with a total failure past n=27. Double precision (in green) gives 50 bits and sees a similar limit at n=27. Long double (in blue) continues to n=211. This places an upper bound on the input size that this utility can usefully handle when instanced using native data types: 2048.\n\nHere is the base-2 log maximum difference. Again, it shows the number of binary digits to which the input and output values agree. The results are largely the same as the RMS, and this test is done merely to demonstrate that the RMS does not average away any outliers.\n\nThese numbers show that the current implementation is useful in a number of circumstances, but not as powerful as we would like. The use of extended-range arithmetic (Lozier & Smith) will take us beyond the inevitable failure of long double precision, and a GPU-cluster implementation will extend the performance envelope by sheer brute force.\nOn the bright side, the spherical harmonic transform is a trivially parallelizable process that fully benefits from all floating point capacity placed at its disposal. He we see the speed-up of the round trip test run at n=29 in double precision with from one to 32 threads. Speed-up is linear to 16 threads, with 90% efficiency, as this is the number of real processor cores in the test system. They're hyperthreaded cores, and modest gains can be achieved by overcommiting them, though this is not reliable.\n\n","240":"Node-mysql-libmysqlclient \nAsynchronous MySQL binding for Node.js using libmysqlclient.\nThis module has been tested with Node.js versions 0.8.26, v0.10.25 and 0.11.10\nOverview\nThese bindings provides all general connection\/querying functions from the MySQL C API,\nand partial support for prepared statements.

The AlphaBeta component is, in fact, just a special type of React component that \"wraps\" the component variants you're testing.\nlightweight: The AlphaBeta package is small and the AlphaBeta component is thin, so AlphaBeta tests won't measurably increase the time it takes for your application to render. Since AlphaBeta is so lightweight, you can be less selective about what you choose to test - it may even make sense to run single-variant tests, wrapping components you may test in the future in an AlphaBeta component today in order to establish a baseline for comparison.\nbackend agnostic: Since split testing requires that you store event data, AlphaBeta needs to communicate with a datastore in order to work. But AlphaBeta will work with whatever datastore you're currently using - just follow the instructions in Backend \/ API Setup to build your endpoint, point AlphaBeta to it, and you're good to go.\nextensible: AlphaBeta is designed to make it easy for developers to integrate basic split tests into their React apps without having to think about the underlying statistics.

Given this information, you should probably stick with variant A.\",\n}\nInstallation\n$ npm install react-alpha-beta --save\nOverview and Basic Usage\nThe AlphaBeta component is a React component that \"wraps\" two other components. These two \"wrapped\" components are passed as ComponentA and ComponentB, and they represent the two variants you're testing. Each user that encounters the AlphaBeta component will see one of the two variants, and the AlphaBeta component will report back to your server (i) which variant was displayed and (ii) if a success event occurred.\nIn addition to your ComponentA and ComponentB variants, you'll also pass experimentParams to each of your AlphaBeta components. experimentParams is an object containing the keys id and testCohortSize.\nid is the unique id of a particular experiment, and is passed by the AlphaBeta component to your Backend \/ API (described below). Each AlphaBeta component that you declare should have a unique id associated with it.\ntestCohortSize is a number between 0.0 and 1.0. Its value tells your AlphaBeta component what proportion of your users will see each experiment variant. A testCohortSize value of 0.01 means that 1% of your users should see the ComponentB variant - the other 99% should see ComponentA. A value of .5 indicates that there should be an even split between the two variants.\nWhen you wrap your variants in an AlphaBeta component, the AlphaBeta component passes the prop successAction to each of them.\nYou get to decide what constitutes \"success\" in the context of your experiment. If you're testing a button variation, \"success\" might be defined as a click (this is the case in the above code sample). If you're testing a landing page variation, \"success\" might be defined as submitting a validated form.\nNote that while you have the ability to define \"success\" however you want, it is also your responsibility to make sure that successAction is fired by each of your variants when \"success\" occurs. Otherwise, AlphaBeta will have no way of giving you guidance about which variant is more likely to produce the desired outcome.\nThe Button example is designed to help you get comfortable using the AlphaBeta component. You'll need to set up your Backend \/ API for the example to work (instructions below), but reading through the example may help you better understand how to use AlphaBeta, even prior to fully setting things up.\nBackend \/ API Setup\nWait, AlphaBeta Needs a Backend?\nIn order for AlphaBeta to be useful, it needs to be able to record data about the experiments you're running. In other words, it needs to be linked to a datastore of some type. This reliance on a datastore isn't unique to AlphaBeta - it is true of split testing in general.\nImagine that you're running an experiment to see if changing a particular button from a transparent background (variant A) to a solid blue background (variant B) leads to more clicks. (If you already looked at the Button example, this should look familiar...)\nTo measure which variant performs better, you need to keep track of each variant's \"impressions\" (how many users have seen each button) and \"conversions\" (how many times each button is clicked).\nWhen we are able to keep track of these values, all it takes is a bit of math to estimate (within a specific range or \"confidence interval\") which button leads to more conversions. AlphaBeta handles this math for you, but you're responsible for logging the events themselves in your datastore.\nSo How Do I Set Up My AlphaBeta Endpoint?\nYou can connect AlphaBeta to a datastore you're already using in two steps.\nStep 1:\nSet up an API endpoint for AlphaBeta to Consume\nAlphaBeta expects to be able to interact with an endpoint at www.yoursite.com\/api\/alphabeta\/{{experimentId}}\/, where {{experimentId}} is the unique id you pass to each AlphaBeta component in experimentParams.\nAlphaBeta will both POST to and GET from this endpoint. When AlphaBeta detects an \"impression\" or a \"conversion\", it will POST to this endpoint, so all users who may encounter an experiment should be able to POST to this endpoint.\nYou can safely restrict GET requests to only allow access to users who should be able to see data about your experiments.\nIt's also a good idea (though not strictly necessary) to set up your endpoint such that GET requests made without an {{experimentId}} return a list of your experiments. This is a good idea if you wish to build a single page where you can view data about all of our experiments.\nEnsure Your Endpoint Accepts POST Requests Correctly\nWhen AlphaBeta POST data to your endpoint, the POST body should look like this:\n{\n    variant: \"a\",             \/\/ this will either be \"a\" or \"b\"\n    success: null,            \/\/ this will either be null or true\n    userCohortValue: .10392,  \/\/ a number between 0 and 1\n    metaId: null,             \/\/ this will be null unless you choose to set it\n}\n\n\nvariant tells your datastore which component variant (A or B) was presented to a particular user.\n\n\nsuccess tells your datastore whether the success event occurred (true) or not (null).\n(Note that the value for this parameter will either be true or null, as opposed to true or false. When success is passed as null, that signals that an impression has occurred. It is passed as null because when the component is loaded we don't know if the user will trigger the success event or not. When success is passed as true, that signals that a success event has occurred.)\n\n\nuserCohortValue is a number between 0.0 and 1.0 that AlphaBeta has associated with the particular user in this experiment. This number is randomly generated the first time a user encounters a particular AlphaBeta experiment, and is core to how AlphaBeta separates users into cohorts.\n\n\nmetaId is a value that you can optionally pass to your AlphaBeta component. It should be used in cases where the component that you're testing occurs more than one time times on your site.\n\n\nHere is an example of when you would set the metaId attribute:\nImagine you instead were testing the copy on a Facebook-style \"like\" button to see if changing \"like\" to \"+1\" led to more engagement. Each piece of content a user views in his\/her news feed should have a \"like\" (or \"+1) button below it. But since each user has multiple items in his\/her feed, a single user could \"like\" more than one piece of content.\nIn this case, you could set a metaId that uniquely identifies the piece of content being \"liked\". If you were to set the metaId, you would be testing which variant leads to more total likes per unit of content seen. If you were to not set the metaId, you would be testing which variant is more likely to lead to a user liking at least one piece of content.\nEnsure Your Endpoint Responds to GET Requests Correctly\nWhen AlphaBeta GETs data from your endpoint, the returned data should look like this\n{\n  variantA: {\n    trialCount:   291,  \/\/ the number of unique impressions for this variant\n    successCount: 59,   \/\/ the number of unique success events for this variant\n  },\n  variantB: {\n    trialCount:   101,\n    successCount: 22,\n  },\n  confidenceInterval: .95 \/\/ the CI you're looking to achieve, expressed as a float\n}\nStep 2:\nEnsure Your Back End Processes POST Requests Correctly\nWhen POST data is received, one of three things is supposed to happen:\n1 - the trialCount for an experiment variant could be incremented by 1.\n2 - the successCount for an experiment could be incremented by 1.\n3 - Nothing at all.\nThe logic for what should happen must be executed by your application's backend. Here's how things should work:\n\n\nif success === null and no previous trial exists where both userCohortValue and metaId are equal to this trial's values, you should increment trialCount by one for the appropriate variant.\n\n\nif success === true and no previous trial exists where both userCohortValue and metaId are equal to this trial's values and success === true, you should increment successCount by one for the appropriate variant.\n\n\nin all other cases, you should not take any action.\n\n\nChecking Your Experiment Results\nimport { getExperimentData } from 'react-alpha-beta';\n\nconsole.log(getExperimentData(experimentId));\nTo view your experiment results, call the getExperimentData function with the experimentId for a particular experiment. It will return a json object with the keys meanDifferenceValue, marginOfError, statisticalSignificance, and details.\n\nmeanDifferenceValue is AlphaBeta's best estimate (or mean estimate) of ComponentB's performance relative to ComponentA. A positive number indicates that ComponentB is leading to more successActions per impression than ComponentA, while a negative number indicates the opposite.\n\nNote that meanDifferenceValue alone doesn't mean much if the experiment hasn't yet reached statistical significance.\n\n\nmarginOfError is the margin of error (or uncertainty) that exists in the experiment.\n\n\nstatisticalSignificance, a boolean, represents whether this experiment has yet reached statistical significance at the level of confidence you defined.\n\n\ndetails is a human readable description of this experiment's current results.\n\n\nSample result from getExperimentData:\n{\n  meanDifferenceValue: -0.05023923444976075,\n  marginOfError: 0.04837299277280508,\n  statisticalSignificance: true,\n  details: \"Our best estimate is that the absolute rate of success is 5% lower with variant B, and this result is statistically significant (We are 95% confident the true difference is between -10% and 0%.). Given this information, you should probably stick with variant A.\",\n}\n\nExample\nNote: in order for this example to work, you must first set up an API endpoint for AlphaBeta to consume. If you haven't done this yet, follow the steps in Backend \/ API Setup\n\nButton example: Set up an experiment to see which of two button variants has a greater click-through rate. This example covers (i) basic experiment setup, (ii) the two ways to pass your variant components to the AlphaBeta component, and (iii) basic usage of the AlphaBeta DevTools.\n\nAlphaBeta DevTools\nAlphaBeta comes with a DevTools component that can be used on any page containing an experiment.\nimport { ABComponent, DevTools } from 'react-alpha-beta';\n\n\/\/ ***\n\/\/ Build your experiment component, which we'll call <Page \/> here.\n\/\/ Make sure that <DevTools \/> is in your <Page \/> component.\n\/\/ ***\n\nReactDOM.render(\n    <Page \/>,\n    document.getElementById('app')\n);\nOne easy way to familiarize yourself with the DevTools component is to load the Button example.\nIf the DevTools component is included on your page and you are not in a production environment (i.e. process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production'), you should see a DevTools box in the lower right hand corner of your screen. This box lets you control your user cohort value for each of the experiments on the page. Recall that the user cohort value for an experiment, along with the testCohortSize parameter, determine which variant a user sees.\nIf the user cohort value is greater than or equal to testCohortSize, the user will see variant A for this experiment. If the user cohort value is less than testCohortSize, the user will see variant B. When you manipulate the DevTools sliders, you are changing your user cohort value for an experiment. These changes will take place when you refresh the page.\nYou can add the DevTools component to the lower level components that contain your experiments, or to higher level components of your application.\nDiscussion and Support\nJoin our Slack team!\nAdditional Resources\n\nA\/B testing course (Udacity)\nHypothesis testing with one sample (Khan Academy)\n\nLint\n$ npm run lint\nTest\n$ npm run test        # run once\n$ npm run test:watch  # continuous testing as file changes\n$ npm run test:cov    # generate test coverage report\nContribute\nWe are using commitizen to make commit format consistent.\n# Install the command line tool.\n$ npm install -g commitizen\n\n# From then on, whenever you would like to commit:\n$ git add .\n$ git cz\n# ... follow the prompt messages\nLicense\nMIT\nCredits\n\nJack McCloy\nBrian Park\nBen Hall\n\n","244":"Famous Examples\n##DEPRECATED: please find our examples inside of our main repo\nLicense\nAll the code in the src\/examples folder is licensed under the MIT license.

This package adds automatic user identification by using hooks in the Meteor accounts package and building on Segment.io's analytics package through the @okgrow\/auto-analytics package.\nAnalytics 2.1.0+\nOur Analytics package has been rewritten to be router agnostic. You should be able to use this package with any router that you use with Meteor app. We have tested and used our Analytics package with iron-router, flow-router, and react-router. You can view and test this out in our iron-router, flow-router and react-router example apps located in the examples folder.\nNOTE: A fundamental change that may affect some applications is that we no longer look for or use the router's route name when logging page views. Instead we use document.title. This may affect applications that do not change or set their document.title for each screen or page of their application. The simplest solution is to simply set document title like this document.title = \"My new title\"; for each screen or page in your application. If you are using flow router or iron router you can remain at okgrow:analytics@2.0.1 to keep using the name of the route for your analytic events.\nPre Meteor 1.3.1\nFor Meteor Apps older than v1.3.1, please use v1.0.9 of this package. Going forward this package will officially only be supporting Meteor Apps >= v1.3.1\nInstall\nIn your Meteor project folder, run:\nmeteor add okgrow:analytics\nUsage\nThis package will automatically configure the underlying @okgrow\/auto-analytics package using Meteor.settings.public.analyticsSettings. In Meteor you typically specify your settings using a settings.json file:\n{\n  \"public\": {\n    \"analyticsSettings\": {\n      \/\/ Add your analytics tracking ids here (remove this line before running)\n      \"Google Analytics\" : {\"trackingId\": \"Your tracking ID\"},\n      \"Amplitude\"        : {\"apiKey\": \"...\"},\n      \"Chartbeat\"        : {\"uid\": \"...\"},\n      \"comScore\"         : {\"c2\": \"...\"},\n      \"HubSpot\"          : {\"portalId\": \"...\"},\n      \"Intercom\"         : {\"appId\": \"...\"},\n      \"Keen IO\"          : {\"projectId\": \"...\", \"writeKey\": \"...\"},\n      \"KISSmetrics\"      : {\"apiKey\": \"...\"},\n      \"Mixpanel\"         : {\"token\":  \"...\", \"people\": true},\n      \"Quantcast\"        : {\"pCode\": \"...\"},\n      \"Segment.io\"       : {\"apiKey\": \"...\"}\n    }\n  }\n}\nAnd run your app with that settings file as follows:\nmeteor --settings settings.json\nSee the @okgrow\/auto-analytics package for more details on configuration.\nCurrently Supported Analytic Services\nSee the @okgrow\/auto-analytics package for up-to-date details of supported analytics services.\nPage views\nSee the @okgrow\/auto-analytics package for details on page view tracking. In short, that package uses the browser History API to automatically track page views.\nSince the History API is used to automatically track page views, document.title is used instead of the router's route name as the default page name.\nIf you rely on your router's route name for the page name in page view events, you can easily set document.title programming using the router's route name. Here are examples of how to do this with React Router, Flow Router and Iron Router:\nRouters\nThis package is router agnostic. It will work with any router, and by default it uses the document.title as the page name for reporting to your analytics service.\nReact Router\nIn your router setup, add a name property to your routes:\n<Router history={ browserHistory }>\n  <Route path=\"\/\" name=\"Home\" component={ App } \/>\n  <Route path=\"\/one\" name=\"One\" component={ App } \/>\n  <Route path=\"\/two\" name=\"Two\" component={ App } \/>\n  <Route path=\"\/three\" name=\"Three\" component={ App } \/>\n<\/Router>\nNOTE The current route is passed in as a property named route to your component.\nThen, in the render() function of your main layout component, using a package like react-document-title:\nrender() {\n  return (\n    <DocumentTitle title={this.props.route.name}>\n      ...\n    <\/DocumentTitle>\n  );\n}\nFlow Router\nTemplate.mainLayout.onRendered(function() {\n  Tracker.autorun(() => {\n    document.title = FlowRouter.getRouteName();\n  });\n});\nIron Router\nTemplate.mainLayout.onRendered(function() {\n  Tracker.autorun(() => {\n    document.title = Router.current().route.getName();\n  });\n});\nDisabling automatic page views\nTo disable automatic page view tracking change Meteor.settings as shown below then manually log a page view by calling analytics.page('page name'):\n{\n  \"public\": {\n    \"analyticsSettings\": {\n      \/\/ Disable autorun if you do not want analytics running on every route (remove this line before running)\n      \"autorun\"  : false\n    }\n  }\n}\nLog signin\/signout\nIf you have the accounts package installed, this package will automatically track when a user logs in and logs out. Logging in will call identify on the user and associate their Meteor.userId to their previous anonymous activities.\nEvent tracking\nSee the @okgrow\/auto-analytics package for details on event tracking. In short, track any event by calling the analytics.track() function:\nanalytics.track(\"Bought Ticket\", {\n  eventName: \"Wine Tasting\",\n  couponValue: 50,\n});\nTrack visitor scrolling\nJosh Owens' article, Google Analytics events, goals, and Meteor.js, goes over a great way to capture how far a visitor has scrolled down a page.\nBrowser Policy\nIf your project uses the Browser Policy package, we've included the Google Analytics and MixPanel domains in our browser policy configuration. Any additional services you add will need to be added to your browser policy config as well.\nExample browser policy\nBrowserPolicy.content.allowOriginForAll(\"www.google-analytics.com\");\nBrowserPolicy.content.allowOriginForAll(\"cdn.mxpnl.com\");\nIf your project doesn't use the Browser Policy package, don't worry, it won't affect your usage.\nDebugging\nTo log package activity to the console for debugging purposes, turn on debugging in the console:\n> analytics.debug()\nTurn debug logging off with:\n> analytics.debug(false)\nURL Whitelisting on Android Devices\nIf your app is running on Android devices you will probably have to add the cordova-plugin-whitelist package and set access rules in your mobile-config.js for all URLs of the platforms that you are using.\nExample for Intercom:\nApp.accessRule('https:\/\/js.intercomcdn.com\/*');\nApp.accessRule('https:\/\/static.intercomcdn.com\/*');\nApp.accessRule('https:\/\/api-iam.intercom.io\/*');\nApp.accessRule('https:\/\/widget.intercom.io\/*');\nApp.accessRule('https:\/\/nexus-websocket-a.intercom.io\/*');\nApp.accessRule('https:\/\/nexus-websocket-b.intercom.io\/*');\n\nTo find all the necessary URLs for your project, build your production app and install it on your Android device. Then connect it via USB and open the Android Studio Device Monitor (Tools >> Android Device Monitor >> LogCat). Perform a relevant action and then search for \"whitelist\". It should a show message for each URL that was blocked.\nAd-blocker\nWhen running your Meteor app in \"development mode\" ad-blocking web-browser extensions may block the okgrow:analytics package due to the word \"analytics\" in the package name. This only occurs when running Meteor in \"development mode\" because files are not bundled together and minified. To work around this issue you can disable your ad-blocker when running in development mode.\nTo test that application with an ad-blocker, run your Meteor app in production mode with this command:\nmeteor run --production --settings settings.json\nNOTE If an ad-blocker is enabled the expected behavior is that analytic events will not be received. You'll see an error message in your console reporting the events being blocked.\nExample React, Flow and Iron Router Apps\nWhile page view event tracking is router agnostic, the examples directory contains example apps using the three most common routers used in Meteor apps: React Router, Flow Router and Iron Router. These apps can be run from within their respective directories with:\nmeteor npm start\nMaintainers\nThis is an open source package.

In order to\ninstall it simply run pip install brownie or easy_install brownie,\nshould you prefer the latter, to get the latest stable version.\nIf you really need to, you can also install the development version of\nBrownie with pip install brownie==dev. However I do not recommend it.\n\nDevelopment\nShould you want to participate in the development, fork the repository on\nGithub and take a moment to read :ref:`contributing`, for a couple of\ngeneral and not so general guidelines you should follow.\n","252":"YUNOMI: Y U NO MEASURE IT\n\n\nAs in:\n\nIt has performance implications, Y U NO MEASURE IT!?\nYunomi provides insights to the internal behavior of an application, providing useful statistics and metrics on selected portions of your code.\nIt\u2019s a Python port of the core portion of a Java Metrics library by Coda Hale.\nStop guessing, start measuring:\n$ pip install yunomi\n\nCore Features\n\nCounter\nSimple interface to increment and decrement a value.\nFor example, this can be used to measure the total number of jobs sent to the queue, as well as the pending (not yet complete) number of jobs in the queue.\nSimply increment the counter when an operation starts and decrement it when it completes.\n\nMeter\nMeasures the rate of events over time.\nUseful to track how often a certain portion of your application gets requests so you can set resources accordingly.\nTracks the mean rate (the overall rate since the meter was reset) and the rate statistically significant regarding only events that have happened in the last 1, 5, and 15 minutes (Exponentially weighted moving average).\n\nHistogram\nMeasures the statistical distribution of values in a data stream.\nKeeps track of minimum, maximum, mean, standard deviation, etc.\nIt also measures median, 75th, 90th, 95th, 98th, 99th, and 99.9th percentiles.\nAn example use case would be for looking at the number of daily logins for 99 percent of your days, ignoring outliers.\n\nTimer\nA useful combination of the Meter and the Histogram letting you measure the rate that a portion of code is called and a distribution of the duration of an operation.\nYou can see, for example, how often your code hits the database and how long those operations tend to take.\n\nExamples\n\nDecorators\nThe simplest and easiest way to use the yunomi library.\n\nCounter\nYou can use the count_calls decorator to count the number of times a function is called.\n>>> from yunomi import counter, count_calls\n>>> @count_calls\n... def test():\n...     pass\n...\n>>> for i in xrange(10):\n...     test()\n...\n>>> print counter(\"test_calls\").get_count()\n10\n\nTimer\nYou can use the time_calls decorator to time the execution of a function and get distributtion data from it.\n>>> import time\n>>> from yunomi import timer, time_calls\n>>> @time_calls\n... def test():\n...     time.sleep(0.1)\n...\n>>> for i in xrange(10):\n...     test()\n...\n>>> print timer(\"test_calls\").get_mean()\n0.100820207596\n\nRequirements\nYunomi has no external dependencies and runs on PyPy and Python 2.6, 2.7, and 3.3.\n","253":"About\nA simple and efficient paginator.\n\nJinja2\nJinja2 is supported via Coffin:\n{% with paginate(request, my_queryset) as results %}\n  {{ results.paging }}\n  {% for result in results.objects %}\n    {{ result }}\n  {% endfor %}\n  {{ results.paging }}\n{% endwith %}\n\n\nDjango\nDjango templatetags require django-templatetag-sugar:\n{% load paging_extras %}\n\n{% paginate my_queryset from request as results %}\n{{ results.paging }}\n{% for result in results.objects %}\n  {{ result }}\n{% endfor %}\n{{ results.paging }}\n\n","254":"GoogleClosureCompiler\nMakes integrating the Google JavaScript Compiler with your Rails deployment process dead simple. Read why compressing your JavaScript is important\nBoth the Google Closure Compiler API and Application are supported. Sensible defaults are provided.\nInstalling the plugin\nscript\/plugin install git:\/\/github.com\/mkelly12\/google_closure_compiler.git\n\nRequirements\nAny version of Rails 2.x; including Rails 2.3.4 and 2.1.2.\nSo how does it work?\nRead how this integrates with your workflow\nThe plugin uses the Google Closure Compiler to optimize JavaScript files cached by Rails.\nAnytime you use the javascript_include_tag with the :cache => true or :cache => 'bundle_name' the resulting JavaScript file will be compiled. Read more about Rails asset caching\nYou will also need this in your production.rb (and in your development.rb only when testing):\nconfig.action_controller.perform_caching = true\n\nKeep in mind that cached files are saved to your public directory and only generated when needed. If you forget to delete them in the development environment they can lead to some serious headaches. It's a good practice to use a naming scheme like 'cache\/bundle_name' so you can easily remove the cached files and add ignore rules to your version control.\nHow does it work with the Google Closure Compiler?\nThere are three ways to integrate with the Google Closure Compiler which are attempted in the following order:\n\nIf you have the Closure Compiler Application properly installed (yes we check this) then that is always used.\nIf the Application is not detected then the API is used with your JavaScript embeded in the POST data.\nIf your JavaScript file is larger then POST data will allow then a link to your JavaScript is sent to the API. If your host is not specified or not reachable by the Google service then no compilation is performed.\n\nApplication\nThe preferred method is to use the compile.jar file which is included in this plugin.\nYou will need the Java Runtime Environment version 6.\nIf you are on OS X with the latest updates you will need to specify the path to the 1.6 JRE since \/usr\/bin\/java still point to 1.5.\nAdd the following to \/config\/google_closure_compiler.yml\ndevelopment:\n\tjava_path: '\/System\/Library\/Frameworks\/JavaVM.framework\/Versions\/1.6\/Commands\/java'\n\nAPI with code in request\nYou don't need anything besides an outgoing internet connection. However you JavaScript needs to fit in the POST data.\nAPI with code urls\nThis works well if your server is accessible to the world and you specified your host name using the following:\nconfig.action_mailer.default_url_options = { :host => HOST_NAME }\n\nThe only limitation is that cached JavaScript files larger then 500k cannot be processed with this method.\nUsing the Google Closure Library\nIf you are using the Google Closure Library use the following view helper to include your Closure JavaScript:\nclosure_include_tag \"wooly_zurbian.js\"\n\nIn this example wooly_zurbian.js is a JavaScript file in \/public\/javascripts\/.\nThis helper inserts the Google Closure Library base.js and events.js scripts when perform_caching is false. When perform_caching is true these files are not required since they are added using the calcdeps.py script.\nThe Google Closure Library is required and is assumed to be in public\/javascripts\/closure. If you put it somewhere else specify the relative path from \/public\/javascripts\/ using closure_library_path in google_closure_compiler.yml.\nThe wooly_zurbian.js script is inserted and cached in \/public\/javascripts\/cache\/closure\/wooly_zurbian.js.\nUsing the Dependency Calculation Script\nIf any of your cached JavaScript files contain a call to goog.require() then that cached file will be expanded using the calcdeps.py script. This requires Python 2.4 or greater and the Google Closure Library (see Using the Google Closure Library).\ncalcdeps.py takes each goog.require() call and replaces it with the required libraries. Read more about calcdeps.py and why it is important when using the Google Closure Library.\nADVANCED_OPTIMIZATIONS is used for the compilation of cached file that are expanded with calcdeps.py regardless of what is specified in the \/config\/google_closure_compiler.yml file.\nFAQ\nCan I change the compilation level?\nYes, you can specify it in the config\/google_closure_compiler.yml file.\ndevelopment:\n\tcompilation_level: 'ADVANCED_OPTIMIZATIONS'\n\nThe default is SIMPLE_OPTIMIZATIONS. Other options are WHITESPACE_ONLY and ADVANCED_OPTIMIZATIONS.\nMake sure you read the documentation on Advanced Optimizations before enabling them.\nWhat happens if there is an error or the API is down?\nIf all compilation methods fail then the original JavaScripts are used in the bundles.\nDoes this play nice with Smurf?\nIt sure does. If you have Smurf installed then CSS minification works as expected and JavaScript files are processed by both Smurf and the Google Closure Compiler.\nCopyright (c) 2009 Matt Kelly - ZURB, released under the MIT license\n","255":"Japont\nDynamic Subsetting System for CJK fonts.\n\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u30c8\u3092\u8efd\u91cf\u5316\u3057\u3066\u914d\u4fe1\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306b\uff0c\u52d5\u7684\u306b\u5fc5\u8981\u6587\u5b57\u3092\u62bd\u51fa\u3057\u305fWeb\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u30c8\u3092\u751f\u6210\u3059\u308b\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\n\u6bd4\u8f03\u7684\u7c21\u5358\u306b\u65e5\u672c\u8a9eWeb\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u30c8\u3092\u5c0e\u5165\u3067\u304d\u307e\u3059\n\u26a0\ufe0f Notice\nThis branch is under developing.\nIf you use Japont, please access with-fonttools branch.\nDEMO\nDEMO\nInstallation\nWIP\nUsage\nWIP\nEnvironment variables\n\n\n\nENVS\nDefault\nNote\n\n\n\n\nX_ROBOTS_TAG\nnoindex, nofollow\nX-Robots-Tag Header\n\n\nSERVER_OWNER\nAnonymous\nServer owner's name\n\n\nFONTS_DIR_PATH\n.\/fonts\nFolder path where fonts are\n\n\nZIP_COMPRESSION_TYPE\nZIP_STORED\n\n\n\nBIND_IP\n0.0.0.0\n\n\n\nPORT\n8000\n\n\n\n\nContribution\n\nFork it ( http:\/\/github.com\/Japont\/Japont-core\/fork )\nCreate your feature branch ( git checkout -b my-new-feature )\nCommit your changes ( git commit -am 'Add some feature' )\nPush to the branch ( git push origin my-new-feature )\nCreate new Pull Request\n\nLICENSE\nApply the Apache License version 2.0.\nApache License version 2.0 \u3092\u9069\u7528\u3057\u307e\u3059\uff0e\nCopyright 2015- 3846masa\nAuthor\n 3846masa\n","256":"What about running nose with a smarter interactive debugger?\nUse this and never risk yourself forgetting import ipdb; ipdb.set_trace() in your code again!\nThis plugin is 99.99% based on nose's builtin debug plugin.\nIf you have any ideas about how to improve it, come and fork the code at http:\/\/github.com\/flavioamieiro\/nose-ipdb\nInstall\npip install ipdbplugin\n\nUsage\nTo drop into ipdb on errors:\nnosetests --ipdb\n\nTo drop into ipdb on failures:\nnosetests --ipdb-failures\n\nLicense\nGNU Lesser General Public License\nAuthors\n\nBernardo Fontes (falecomigo@bernardofontes.net)\nFl\u00e1vio Amieiro (amieiro.flavio@gmail.com)\nHenrique Bastos (henrique@bastos.net)\n\n","257":"django-compat\n\n\n\n\nForward and backwards compatibility layer for Django 1.4, 1.7, 1.8, 1.9, 1.10 and 1.11\nConsider django-compat as an experiment based on the discussion on reddit.

This repo is used to build and maintain the site.\nIf you want to contribute to the improving the site, back-end, front-end etc. Just fork away and submit pull requests.\nSample Implementations\nCheckout the static\/ folder to see some of the sample implementations of Zippopotamus for inspiration and examples for how to implement Zippopotamus API for use in your website etc.\nIf you want to share an implementation, we would love to post example cases of Zippopotamus on our homepage.\nResponse Format\nOn May 1st Zippopotamus changed their JSON response format to work better with international postal codes.  Now we support a one-to-many format service. That is that one zip code may map to many regions, this is common in countries like Spain and France (but not in the US and Germany).\nPostal Code Information\nFor information our postal codes and countries supported, you should check out the zippopotamus crowd-sourcing project.  Here you can download the entire database dump, or fork and add changes that we will incorporate into our DB.\nTechnical Information\nWhat is Zippopotamus built on\nAt the moment the zippopotamus is built on Python, MongoDB and bottle.py framework.\nLocal Testing?\nThe site is configured to run on dotCloud, if you want to test out the web interfaceyou can change the wsgi.py file to include the last commented line, which is used to run the site on your local host.\nSuggestions and Comments?\nHate it? Love it? Open an issue if you have a problem or contact\nJeff Crowell or Samir Ahmed\nAlso, we aren't bottle or python or mongo experts. So if you see a way that we can improve, please let us know. Additionally, if you have examples (translation corrects etc) of using Zippopotamus that you want to share let us know and we can feature your site \/ blog on the homepage.\n","260":"mongo-spark\nExample application on how to use mongo-hadoop connector with Apache Spark.\nRead more details at http:\/\/codeforhire.com\/2014\/02\/18\/using-spark-with-mongodb\/\nPrerequisites\n\nMongoDB installed and running on localhost\nScala 2.10 and SBT installed\n\nRunning\nImport data into the database, run either JavaWordCount or ScalaWordCount and print the results.\nmongoimport -d beowulf -c input beowulf.json\nsbt 'run-main JavaWordCount'\nsbt 'run-main ScalaWordCount'\nmongo beowulf --eval 'printjson(db.output.find().toArray())' | less\n\nLicense\nThe code itself is released to the public domain according to the Creative Commons CC0.\nThe example files are based on Beowulf from Project Gutenberg and is under its corresponding license.\n","261":"CollapseLayout\nCollapseLayout can collapse\/expand layout with smooth animation.\nHere is a gif showing the effect:\n\nHow to use\n<com.example.collapselayout.CollapseLayout\n\tandroid:id=\"@+id\/el\"\n\tandroid:layout_width=\"match_parent\"\n\tandroid:layout_height=\"wrap_content\" >\n\t\n\t<LinearLayout\n        android:layout_width=\"match_parent\"\n        android:layout_height=\"wrap_content\"\n        android:orientation=\"vertical\" >\n        \n        .........\n        \n\t<\/LinearLayout>\n\t\n<\/com.example.collapselayout.CollapseLayout>\npublic void showEffect(View v) {\n\tint modeId = modeGroup.getCheckedRadioButtonId();\n\tswitch (modeId) {\n\tcase R.id.fixedTop:\n\t\tel.setCollapseMode(Mode.FIXED_START);\n\t\tbreak;\n\tcase R.id.fixedBottom:\n\t\tel.setCollapseMode(Mode.FIXED_END);\n\t\tbreak;\n\t}\n\t\n\tint interpolatorId = interpolatorGroup.getCheckedRadioButtonId();\n\tswitch (interpolatorId) {\n\tcase R.id.linear:\n\t\tel.setInterpolator(linearInterpolator);\n\t\tbreak;\n\tcase R.id.bounce:\n\t\tel.setInterpolator(bounceInterpolator);\n\t\tbreak;\n\tcase R.id.accelerate:\n\t\tel.setInterpolator(accelerateDecelerateInterpolator);\n\t\tbreak;\n\t}\n\t\n\tint orientationId = orientationGroup.getCheckedRadioButtonId();\n\tswitch (orientationId) {\n\tcase R.id.vertical:\n\t\tel.setCollapseOrientation(Orientation.VERTICAL);\n\t\tbreak;\n\tcase R.id.horizontal:\n\t\tel.setCollapseOrientation(Orientation.HORIZONTAL);\n\t\tbreak;\n\t}\n\t\n\tint state = el.getState();\n\tswitch (state) {\n\tcase CollapseLayout.STATE_OPEN:\n\t\tel.close();\n\t\tbreak;\n\tcase CollapseLayout.STATE_CLOSE:\n\t\tel.open();\n\t\tbreak;\n\t}\n}\n<declare-styleable name=\"CollapseLayout\">\n\t<attr name=\"collapseOrientation\">\n\t    <enum name=\"vertical\" value=\"0\" \/>\n\t    <enum name=\"horizontal\" value=\"1\" \/>\n\t<\/attr>\n\t<attr name=\"collapseMode\">\n\t    <enum name=\"fixed_end\" value=\"0\"\/>\n\t    <enum name=\"fixed_start\" value=\"1\"\/>\n\t<\/attr>\n\t<attr name=\"initialCollapseState\">\n\t    <enum name=\"open\" value=\"0\"\/>\n\t    <enum name=\"close\" value=\"1\"\/>\n\t<\/attr>\n\t<attr name=\"collapseDuration\" format=\"integer\"\/>\n<\/declare-styleable>\n","262":"Kafka Graphite Metrics Reporter\n\nThis is a simple reporter for kafka using the\nGraphiteReporter.

The phrase is encrypted with a simple substitution cipher, meaning that each letter in the alphabet is replaced with another letter (for example, all A's might be replaced with Q's). You start out with the ciphertext, and you decode it letter-by-letter until you reveal the plaintext message.\nFeatures:\n\nThousands of phrases to decrypt\nThree gritty graphical themes to choose from\nUnlimited hints to curb frustration\nLearn interesting facts and quotes about encryption, cypherpunks, and code-breaking\n\nLicense\nThis game is licensed under the GNU General Public License (see gpl.txt).

For a couple of years they happily made iPhone and Android games. They quickly realized that unless you\u2019re incredibly lucky, it\u2019s hard to make enough money developing indie mobile games to pay San Francisco rent. So Micah got a full time job and Crystal moved on to other things.\nNow, several years later, Micah works for the Electronic Frontier Foundation defending internet users from evil (https:\/\/www.eff.org\/files\/xkcd_comic.png), and Crystal is a freelance web designer (http:\/\/moonsprocket.com\/). But Insurgent Games is dormant.\nSince they're not working on the games anymore, they decided to release them to the community. They hope their games will thrive and be reborn as bigger and better things.

If your looking for an Object.observe solution you should take a look at https:\/\/github.com\/MaxArt2501\/object-observe\nNeeds a maintainer\nI'd like to find someone who is willing to take this library over.  I've had no time to work with and\/or maintain the library.  Honestly I have little need for Object.observe making it hard to justify time spent against it.\nSo, if your using this shim, feel comfortable with the code, and would like to maintain it, let me know.\nIf your curious why I don't have much use for the library, this http:\/\/markdalgleish.github.io\/presentation-a-state-of-change-object-observe\/ pretty well sums it up.  I worked in native development when two way data binding caused all sorts of issues with application development, and I see the same coming out of Object.observe at the end of the day.\nHopefully, someone will want to maintain this work in the future.\nOh, and if you take it over, feel free to relicense it within reason as it seems no one likes unlicense :).  Also feel free to follow up on the polyfill-service integration if you so see fit (https:\/\/github.com\/Financial-Times\/polyfill-service\/pull\/81#issuecomment-66382432).\nObject.observe Polyfill\/shim\nThanks to my new job I have a lot more time to devote to things like this library.  It has gone a REALLY long time without updates and there is a lot that can be done to make it more functional.  I hope to be spending more time on it soon, but for now I've fixed all the bugs that I know of and have been reported.  Thanks to everyone for their reports, and keep them coming if you find one.\nStarted as GIST: https:\/\/gist.github.com\/4173299\nTested against Chromium build with Object.observe and acts EXACTLY the same for the basics, though Chromium build is MUCH faster.\nTrying to stay as close to the spec as possible, this is a work in progress, feel free to comment\/update\nhttp:\/\/wiki.ecmascript.org\/doku.php?id=harmony:observe\nTODO\nThe spec has changed a lot since I origionally wrote this, need to go back and add in a lot of things like custom update types and other fun.  For now though it seems to suffice.\nLimits so far\nBuilt using polling in combination with getter&setters.  This means that if you do something quick enough it won't get caught.\nExample:\nvar myObject = {};\nObject.observe(myObject, console.log);\nmyObject.foo = \"bar\";\ndelete myObject.foo;\nThe observer function would never see the addition of foo since it was deleted so quickly.\nTesting\nTo run the tests first make sure you have Node.js installed.  Then use NPM to install Karam and all dependencies:\nnpm install\n\nFinally run the tests with:\nnpm test\n\nPlanned Updates\nFor FireFox using Proxies will result in better performance.

Sensible defaults are provided.\nInstalling the plugin\nscript\/plugin install git:\/\/github.com\/mkelly12\/google_closure_compiler.git\n\nRequirements\nAny version of Rails 2.x; including Rails 2.3.4 and 2.1.2.\nSo how does it work?\nRead how this integrates with your workflow\nThe plugin uses the Google Closure Compiler to optimize JavaScript files cached by Rails.\nAnytime you use the javascript_include_tag with the :cache => true or :cache => 'bundle_name' the resulting JavaScript file will be compiled. Read more about Rails asset caching\nYou will also need this in your production.rb (and in your development.rb only when testing):\nconfig.action_controller.perform_caching = true\n\nKeep in mind that cached files are saved to your public directory and only generated when needed. If you forget to delete them in the development environment they can lead to some serious headaches. It's a good practice to use a naming scheme like 'cache\/bundle_name' so you can easily remove the cached files and add ignore rules to your version control.\nHow does it work with the Google Closure Compiler?\nThere are three ways to integrate with the Google Closure Compiler which are attempted in the following order:\n\nIf you have the Closure Compiler Application properly installed (yes we check this) then that is always used.\nIf the Application is not detected then the API is used with your JavaScript embeded in the POST data.\nIf your JavaScript file is larger then POST data will allow then a link to your JavaScript is sent to the API. If your host is not specified or not reachable by the Google service then no compilation is performed.\n\nApplication\nThe preferred method is to use the compile.jar file which is included in this plugin.\nYou will need the Java Runtime Environment version 6.\nIf you are on OS X with the latest updates you will need to specify the path to the 1.6 JRE since \/usr\/bin\/java still point to 1.5.\nAdd the following to \/config\/google_closure_compiler.yml\ndevelopment:\n\tjava_path: '\/System\/Library\/Frameworks\/JavaVM.framework\/Versions\/1.6\/Commands\/java'\n\nAPI with code in request\nYou don't need anything besides an outgoing internet connection. However you JavaScript needs to fit in the POST data.\nAPI with code urls\nThis works well if your server is accessible to the world and you specified your host name using the following:\nconfig.action_mailer.default_url_options = { :host => HOST_NAME }\n\nThe only limitation is that cached JavaScript files larger then 500k cannot be processed with this method.\nUsing the Google Closure Library\nIf you are using the Google Closure Library use the following view helper to include your Closure JavaScript:\nclosure_include_tag \"wooly_zurbian.js\"\n\nIn this example wooly_zurbian.js is a JavaScript file in \/public\/javascripts\/.\nThis helper inserts the Google Closure Library base.js and events.js scripts when perform_caching is false. When perform_caching is true these files are not required since they are added using the calcdeps.py script.\nThe Google Closure Library is required and is assumed to be in public\/javascripts\/closure. If you put it somewhere else specify the relative path from \/public\/javascripts\/ using closure_library_path in google_closure_compiler.yml.\nThe wooly_zurbian.js script is inserted and cached in \/public\/javascripts\/cache\/closure\/wooly_zurbian.js.\nUsing the Dependency Calculation Script\nIf any of your cached JavaScript files contain a call to goog.require() then that cached file will be expanded using the calcdeps.py script. This requires Python 2.4 or greater and the Google Closure Library (see Using the Google Closure Library).\ncalcdeps.py takes each goog.require() call and replaces it with the required libraries. Read more about calcdeps.py and why it is important when using the Google Closure Library.\nADVANCED_OPTIMIZATIONS is used for the compilation of cached file that are expanded with calcdeps.py regardless of what is specified in the \/config\/google_closure_compiler.yml file.\nFAQ\nCan I change the compilation level?\nYes, you can specify it in the config\/google_closure_compiler.yml file.\ndevelopment:\n\tcompilation_level: 'ADVANCED_OPTIMIZATIONS'\n\nThe default is SIMPLE_OPTIMIZATIONS. Other options are WHITESPACE_ONLY and ADVANCED_OPTIMIZATIONS.\nMake sure you read the documentation on Advanced Optimizations before enabling them.\nWhat happens if there is an error or the API is down?\nIf all compilation methods fail then the original JavaScripts are used in the bundles.\nDoes this play nice with Smurf?\nIt sure does. If you have Smurf installed then CSS minification works as expected and JavaScript files are processed by both Smurf and the Google Closure Compiler.\nCopyright (c) 2009 Matt Kelly - ZURB, released under the MIT license\n","290":"Japont\nDynamic Subsetting System for CJK fonts.\n\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u30c8\u3092\u8efd\u91cf\u5316\u3057\u3066\u914d\u4fe1\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306b\uff0c\u52d5\u7684\u306b\u5fc5\u8981\u6587\u5b57\u3092\u62bd\u51fa\u3057\u305fWeb\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u30c8\u3092\u751f\u6210\u3059\u308b\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\n\u6bd4\u8f03\u7684\u7c21\u5358\u306b\u65e5\u672c\u8a9eWeb\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u30c8\u3092\u5c0e\u5165\u3067\u304d\u307e\u3059\n\u26a0\ufe0f Notice\nThis branch is under developing.\nIf you use Japont, please access with-fonttools branch.\nDEMO\nDEMO\nInstallation\nWIP\nUsage\nWIP\nEnvironment variables\n\n\n\nENVS\nDefault\nNote\n\n\n\n\nX_ROBOTS_TAG\nnoindex, nofollow\nX-Robots-Tag Header\n\n\nSERVER_OWNER\nAnonymous\nServer owner's name\n\n\nFONTS_DIR_PATH\n.\/fonts\nFolder path where fonts are\n\n\nZIP_COMPRESSION_TYPE\nZIP_STORED\n\n\n\nBIND_IP\n0.0.0.0\n\n\n\nPORT\n8000\n\n\n\n\nContribution\n\nFork it ( http:\/\/github.com\/Japont\/Japont-core\/fork )\nCreate your feature branch ( git checkout -b my-new-feature )\nCommit your changes ( git commit -am 'Add some feature' )\nPush to the branch ( git push origin my-new-feature )\nCreate new Pull Request\n\nLICENSE\nApply the Apache License version 2.0.\nApache License version 2.0 \u3092\u9069\u7528\u3057\u307e\u3059\uff0e\nCopyright 2015- 3846masa\nAuthor\n 3846masa\n","291":"What about running nose with a smarter interactive debugger?\nUse this and never risk yourself forgetting import ipdb; ipdb.set_trace() in your code again!\nThis plugin is 99.99% based on nose's builtin debug plugin.\nIf you have any ideas about how to improve it, come and fork the code at http:\/\/github.com\/flavioamieiro\/nose-ipdb\nInstall\npip install ipdbplugin\n\nUsage\nTo drop into ipdb on errors:\nnosetests --ipdb\n\nTo drop into ipdb on failures:\nnosetests --ipdb-failures\n\nLicense\nGNU Lesser General Public License\nAuthors\n\nBernardo Fontes (falecomigo@bernardofontes.net)\nFl\u00e1vio Amieiro (amieiro.flavio@gmail.com)\nHenrique Bastos (henrique@bastos.net)\n\n","292":"django-compat\n\n\n\n\nForward and backwards compatibility layer for Django 1.4, 1.7, 1.8, 1.9, 1.10 and 1.11\nConsider django-compat as an experiment based on the discussion on reddit.

This repo is used to build and maintain the site.\nIf you want to contribute to the improving the site, back-end, front-end etc. Just fork away and submit pull requests.\nSample Implementations\nCheckout the static\/ folder to see some of the sample implementations of Zippopotamus for inspiration and examples for how to implement Zippopotamus API for use in your website etc.\nIf you want to share an implementation, we would love to post example cases of Zippopotamus on our homepage.\nResponse Format\nOn May 1st Zippopotamus changed their JSON response format to work better with international postal codes.  Now we support a one-to-many format service. That is that one zip code may map to many regions, this is common in countries like Spain and France (but not in the US and Germany).\nPostal Code Information\nFor information our postal codes and countries supported, you should check out the zippopotamus crowd-sourcing project.  Here you can download the entire database dump, or fork and add changes that we will incorporate into our DB.\nTechnical Information\nWhat is Zippopotamus built on\nAt the moment the zippopotamus is built on Python, MongoDB and bottle.py framework.\nLocal Testing?\nThe site is configured to run on dotCloud, if you want to test out the web interfaceyou can change the wsgi.py file to include the last commented line, which is used to run the site on your local host.\nSuggestions and Comments?\nHate it? Love it? Open an issue if you have a problem or contact\nJeff Crowell or Samir Ahmed\nAlso, we aren't bottle or python or mongo experts. So if you see a way that we can improve, please let us know. Additionally, if you have examples (translation corrects etc) of using Zippopotamus that you want to share let us know and we can feature your site \/ blog on the homepage.\n","295":"Twitty Twister\nTwitty twister allows you to access twitter-compatible APIs from pure twisted\napps.

Normally you have to do some date trickery to achieve this,\nsince the month's bounds may be any day of the week. With Spans' set-like\noperations and shortcuts the problem becomes a breeze.\nWe start by importing date and daterange\n>>> from datetime import date\n>>> from spans import daterange\nUsing daterange.from_month we can get range representing January in the year\n2000\n>>> month = daterange.from_month(2000, 1)\n>>> month\ndaterange(datetime.date(2000, 1, 1), datetime.date(2000, 2, 1))\nNow we can calculate the ranges for the weeks where the first and last day of\nmonth are\n>>> start_week = daterange.from_date(month.lower, period=\"week\")\n>>> end_week = daterange.from_date(month.last, period=\"week\")\n>>> start_week\ndaterange(datetime.date(1999, 12, 27), datetime.date(2000, 1, 3))\n>>> end_week\ndaterange(datetime.date(2000, 1, 31), datetime.date(2000, 2, 7))\nUsing a union we can express the calendar view.\n>>> start_week.union(month).union(end_week)\ndaterange(datetime.date(1999, 12, 27), datetime.date(2000, 2, 7))\nDo you want to know more? Head over to the\ndocumentation.\n\nUse with Psycopg2\nTo use these range types with Psycopg2 the\nPsycoSpans.\n\nMotivation\nFor a project of mine I started using PostgreSQL's tsrange type and needed\nan equivalent in Python. These range types attempt to mimick PostgreSQL's\nbehavior in every way. Deviating from it is considered as a bug and should be\nreported.\n\nContribute\nI appreciate all the help I can get! Some things to think about:\n\nIf it's a simple fix, such as documentation or trivial bug fix, please file\nan issue or submit a pull request. Make sure to only touch lines relevant to\nthe issue. I don't accept pull requests that simply reformat the code to be\nPEP8-compliant. To me the history of the repository is more important.\nIf it's a feature request or a non-trivial bug, always open an issue first to\ndiscuss the matter. It would be a shame if good work went to waste because a\npull request doesn't fit the scope of this project.\n\nPull requests are credited in the change log which is displayed on PyPI and the\ndocumentaion on Read the Docs.\n","298":"Instadrop\nAutomatically sync your Instagram photos to Dropbox\nA demo application of the Instagram real-time API.\nIt's live! http:\/\/instadrop.appspot.com\nInstallation on Google App Engine\n\nSign up for an App Engine account.\nDownload the App Engine SDK.\nFork and modify our code!

Integrated with timehop\/sticky-headers-recyclerview for sticky headers.\nhttps:\/\/github.com\/timehop\/sticky-headers-recyclerview\n\nMain Characters:\n1. Pull-To-Refresh\nAn enhancement to SwipeRefreshLayout in 2 aspects:\n\n\nIn some versions of android.support library, SwipeRefreshLayout has\nsliding conflict with AppbarLayout. When you pull down RecyclerView, SwipeRefreshLayout will appear instantly, preventing you from pulling down the list.\n\n\nNow you can invoke setRefreshing(true) to show loading progress in onCreate() while the official's can not.\n\n\n2.Load more\n\n\nAutomatically load more data when there are still ${THRESHOLD} items to the bottom (THRESHOLD customizable)\n\n\nIf user slides to the bottom and the loading process is still incomplete, the loading progress animation will be displayed.\n\n\nLayoutManager irrelevant\n\n\n2 indicator styles available: ProgressBar and SwipeRefreshLayout (The SwipeRefreshLayout style is independent of the Android version, with indicator color and background color Customizable. The ProgressBar style is dependent on the Android version. Its Material Design style is only available in API 21+.)\n\n\n3.Loading View \/ Empty View \/ Error View\n4.OnItemClickListener \/ OnItemLongClickListener\n5.Sticky headers\n\nSupports any number of fixed header types\n\n6.Item divider support\n\n\nCustomizable divider width and color\n\n\nYou can customize the length of the blank area on the left \/ top \/ right \/ bottom of the divider (divider will not draw in blank area)\n\n\nSupports horizontal \/ vertical LinearLayoutManager\n\n\n7.Item animation\n\nMaterial Design animation when initing RecyclerView, adding \/ modifying \/ deleting items\n\n8.Support for group display\n9.Get scrolled distance and distance to end\nSimpleRecyclerView added 2 methods to get these distances;\nMeanwhile, these two distances are passed as parameters in SimpleOnScrollListener.onScrolled.\n\/\/Scrolled distance (px)\nint SimpleRecyclerView.getScrolledDistance();\n\n\/\/Distance to end (px)\nint SimpleRecyclerView.getDistanceToEnd();\n\nabstract class SimpleOnScrollListener extends RecyclerView.OnScrollListener {\n  abstract void onScrollStateChanged(int scrolledDistance, int distanceToEnd, int newState);\n  \/**\n  * @param scrolledDistance Scrolled distance (px)\n  * @param distanceToEnd Distance to end (px)\n  * @param velocity Current scroll velocity (positive or negative indicates the direction)\n  *\/\n  abstract void onScrolled(int scrolledDistance, int distanceToEnd, int velocity);\n}\n\nImport\n1.Add binary\nIn build.gradle, add\ncompile 'com.xdandroid:simplerecyclerview:+'\n\n2.Basic usage is the same as official RecyclerView and SwipeRefreshLayout\n\n\nSimple* classes inherit from the official widgets\n\n\nPlease refer to the demo for usage\n\n\nIf you have multiple viewType (Adapter inherits com.xdandroid.simplerecyclerview.Adapter), The ways of setting data to Adapter are the same as RecyclerView.Adapter. You can pass the data set by the constructor, or you can create a method called setList or so, setting data set to the Adapter and refresh UI using notifyDataSetChanged().\n\n\nIf there is only one viewType (Adapter inherits SingleViewTypeAdapter<${JavaBean}>), the method of setting data list to Adapter is:\n\n\n.\nrecyclerView.setAdapter(adapter);\nvoid Adapter.setList(List<${JavaBean}> list);\n\n3.Layout XML\n<com.xdandroid.simplerecyclerview.SimpleSwipeRefreshLayout\n    tools:context=\"com.xdandroid.sample.MainActivity\"\n    xmlns:android=\"http:\/\/schemas.android.com\/apk\/res\/android\"\n    xmlns:app=\"http:\/\/schemas.android.com\/apk\/res-auto\"\n    xmlns:tools=\"http:\/\/schemas.android.com\/tools\"\n    app:layout_behavior=\"@string\/appbar_scrolling_view_behavior\"\n    tools:showIn=\"@layout\/activity_main\"\n    android:layout_width=\"match_parent\"\n    android:layout_height=\"match_parent\"\n    android:id=\"@+id\/swipe_container\">\n\n    <com.xdandroid.simplerecyclerview.SimpleRecyclerView\n        android:layout_width=\"match_parent\"\n        android:layout_height=\"match_parent\"\n        android:id=\"@+id\/recycler_view\"\/>\n\n<\/com.xdandroid.simplerecyclerview.SimpleSwipeRefreshLayout>\n\n<!--Empty View-->\n<TextView\n    android:layout_width=\"match_parent\"\n    android:layout_height=\"match_parent\"\n    android:id=\"@+id\/empty_view\"\n    android:visibility=\"gone\"\/>\n\n<!--Error View-->\n<TextView\n    android:layout_width=\"match_parent\"\n    android:layout_height=\"match_parent\"\n    android:id=\"@+id\/error_view\"\n    android:visibility=\"gone\"\/>\n\n<!--Loading View-->\n<FrameLayout\n    android:layout_width=\"match_parent\"\n    android:layout_height=\"match_parent\"\n    android:id=\"@+id\/loading_view\">\n\n    <ProgressBar\n        android:layout_width=\"wrap_content\"\n        android:layout_height=\"wrap_content\"\n        android:layout_gravity=\"center\"\n        android:layout_marginBottom=\"20dp\"\/>\n\n    <TextView\n        android:layout_width=\"wrap_content\"\n        android:layout_height=\"wrap_content\"\n        android:layout_gravity=\"center\"\n        android:text=\"Hello Loading View\"\n        android:layout_marginTop=\"20dp\"\n        android:textSize=\"20sp\"\n        android:textColor=\"@android:color\/black\"\/>\n<\/FrameLayout>\n\n4.

After new piece of data is parsed:\nFor SingleViewTypeAdapter, Do NOT call List[E].addAll(Collection[? extends E]) on your data set, instead call void SingleViewTypeAdapter.addAll(List[E]) directly. SingleViewTypeAdapter will update the underlying data set automatically.\nFor Adapter, first update your data set using List[E].addAll(Collection[? extends E]), then call void Adapter.onAddedAll(int newDataSize) to notify Adapter that some data has been added to the data set.\n2. boolean hasMoreElements(Void let_activity_or_fragment_implement_these_methods) :\nTell the Adapter whether there is more data to load.\nif needed, you can call void Adapter.setLoadingFalse() to restore the status of not loading more.\nCustomize style:\nadapter.setUseMaterialProgress(true, new int[]{getResources().getColor(R.color.colorAccent)});\n\nWhen the first parameter (boolean useMaterialProgress) is true, SwipeRefreshLayout style is used, otherwise ProgressBar style is used. The second parameter (int[] colors) is available only if useMaterialProgress is true. You can pass an int[] in the method to set the color set of the loading indicator. If there are more than one color in the int[], the indicator will iterate the colors at the frequency of one color per turn.\nadapter.setColorSchemeColors(new int[]{getResources().getColor(R.color.colorAccent)});\n\nCall the method above to change the indicator color at any time.\nprogressView.setProgressBackgroundColor(Color.parseColor(\"#FAFAFA\"));\n\nSet the background color of indicator.\nSet threshold: void Adapter.setThreshold(int threshold);\nFor GridLayoutManager:\nGridLayoutManager gridLayoutManager = new GridLayoutManager(context,SPAN_SIZE);\ngridLayoutManager.setSpanSizeLookup(adapter.getSpanSizeLookup(SPAN_SIZE));\nrecyclerView.setLayoutManager(gridLayoutManager);\n\nPlease refer to GridFragment and GridAdapter in the demo.\nLoading View \/ Empty View \/ Error View\nXML prepare (Please refer to Import - Layout XML)\n\n\nPlace the LoadingView in parallel with the SwipeRefreshLayout element.\n\n\nPlace the ErrorView \/ EmptyView in parallel with the SwipeRefreshLayout element.

One header corresponds to one headerId, so, For items that want to be displayed under the same header, this method should return the same headerId for the items' positions. The number of headerIds the method possibility returns is the number of fixed headers.\nYou can call this method to get the headerId for the current adapterPosition in onViewHolderBind and onBindHeaderViewHolder.\n\n\nRecyclerView.ViewHolder onCreateHeaderViewHolder(ViewGroup parent);\n\n\nvoid onBindHeaderViewHolder(RecyclerView.ViewHolder holder, int adapterPosition);\n\n\nExample:\n@Override\npublic long getHeaderId(int position) {\n    \/\/This example takes the elements 0-9 as a group, the 10-19 elements as a group, and so on, with every 10 elements belonging to the same group.\n    \/\/For actual use, you can base on position and the data got from List.get(position) to judge the fields inside, to decide which elements belong to which groups.\n    return position \/ 10;\n}\n\n@Override\npublic HeaderVH onCreateHeaderViewHolder(ViewGroup parent) {\n    return new HeaderVH(LayoutInflater.from(parent.getContext()).inflate(R.layout.item_header, parent, false));\n}\n\n@Override\npublic void onBindHeaderViewHolder(HeaderVH holder, int position) {\n    holder.tvHeader.setText(\"Group \" + getHeaderId(position) \/* The group the current header is in. *\/ +\n        \": Adapter Position \" + String.valueOf(position + 1) + \" - \" + String.valueOf(position + 10));\n}\n\nPlease refer to PinnedFragment and PinnedAdapter in the demo.\nGroup display\nType Group[Title, ChildItem] is required to represent a group. Each group contains one title and a number of subitems.\n<Title, ChildItem> Group<Title, ChildItem> {\n    Title title;  \/\/Title of one group\n    List<ChildItem> childItemList;  \/\/Subitem list under one group\n}\n\nTherefore, you need to convert the data to List[Group[Title, ChildItem]], that is, the list of groups.\nYou need to subclass GroupAdapter, and override the following 4 methods:\nViewHolder onTitleVHCreate(ViewGroup parent);\n\nViewHolder onChildItemVHCreate(ViewGroup parent);\n\n\/**\n* @param adapterPos The absolute position of the Title in the Adapter ( = holder.getAdapterPosition()).\n* @param titleOrderInAllTitles The relative position of the Group of the current Title in List[Group].\n*\/\nvoid onTitleVHBind(ViewHolder holder, int adapterPos, Title title, int titleOrderInAllTitles);\n\n\/**\n* @param adapterPos The absolute position of the ChildItem in the Adapter ( = holder.getAdapterPosition()).\n* @param titleOrderInAllTitles The relative position of the Group of the current ChildItem in List[Group].\n* @param childOrderInCurrentGroup The relative position of the current ChildItem in the Group.\n* (The childOrder of the first ChildItem is 0, that is, the childOrder does not include the position of the Title.)\n*\/\nvoid onChildItemVHBind(ViewHolder holder, int adapterPos, Title title,\n    int titleOrderInAllTitles, ChildItem childItem, int childOrderInCurrentGroup);\n\nThe data List[Group] is passed in through the GroupAdapter.setList(List[Group] groupList) method.\nIf you know the absolute position of the Title or ChildItem in the Adapter, and you need to get the Title object, the relative position of the Group of the current Title in List[Group], the ChildItem object and the relative position of the current ChildItem in the Group, You can use 2 methods below on the GroupAdapter:\n\/**\n* According to the absolute position of the Title in the Adapter,\n* get the Title object and the relative position of the Group of the current Title in List[Group].\n* @param positionInRV_viewType_title The absolute position of the Title in the Adapter\uff0c\n* @return TitleChildItemBean {Title title;  int titleOrder;}\n*\/\nTitleChildItemBean<Title, Void> getTitleWithOrder(int positionInRV_viewType_title)\n\n\/**\n* According to the absolute position of the ChildItem in the Adapter,\n* get the Title object, the relative position of the Group of the current Title in List[Group],\n* the ChildItem object and the relative position of the current ChildItem in the Group.\n* @param positionInRV_viewType_childItem The absolute position of the ChildItem in the Adapter.\n* @return TitleChildItemBean {Title title;  int titleOrder;\n    ChildItem childItem;  int childOrder;}\n*\/\nTitleChildItemBean<Title, ChildItem> getTitleAndChildItem(int positionInRV_viewType_childItem)\n\nSet OnGroupItemClickListener and OnGroupItemLongClickListener:\nGroupAdapter.setOnGroupItemClickListener(OnGroupItemClickListener l);\n\nvoid onGroupItemClick(ViewHolder holder, View v, int adapterPos, int viewType,\n   Title title, int titleOrder, ChildItem childItem, int childOrder);\n\nGroupAdapter.setOnGroupItemLongClickListener(OnGroupItemLongClickListener l);\n\nboolean onGroupItemLongClick(ViewHolder holder, View v, int adapterPos, int viewType,\n   Title title, int titleOrder, ChildItem childItem, int childOrder);\n\nAs with the SingleViewTypeAdapter, the GroupAdapter provides a set of methods for easily manipulating data sets held by the Adapter:\n- void setList(List<Group<Title, ChildItem>> groupList);\n- void add(Group<Title, ChildItem> group);\n- void add(int position, Group<Title, ChildItem> group);\n- void remove(int position);\n- void removeLast(); \/ void remove();\n- void removeAll(int positionStart, int itemCount);\n- void set(int position, Group<Title, ChildItem> group);\n- void setAll(int positionStart, int itemCount, Group group);\n- void addAll(int position, List<Group> newGroupList);\n- void addAll(List<Group<Title, ChildItem>> newGroupList);\n\nPlease refer to the codes and comments of GroupAdapter. There is also an example usage in GroupFragment and GroupRVAdapter of the demo.\n","300":"Morphos\n\n\n\n\n They say a pic is worth a 1000 words.

Go ahead and create the following simple Morpho :\nView viewToAnimate = ... ;\nMorpho morph = new Morpho(viewToAnimate)\n  .translate(50,50,0,1500) \/\/ will translate the view (x=50,y=50,z=0) in 1500 milliseconds, \n  .rotationXY(45,45,2000); \/\/ will rotate the view by 45 degrees on both the X-axis and Y-axis in 2000 milliseconds\nYou can then animate it by doing\nmorph.animate(); \nWhich will then animate the desired Morphos using the default animation type (SEQUENTIAL).\nWhat if I want to reverse the animation?

For example : morphoOne.translate(100,0,0,3000).scale(2,2,2000).animate() will execute the translation animation in 3 seconds, followed by an upscale animation of 2 seconds\nInterpolator - The overall interpolator (LinearInterpolator)\nanimate()\nanimate(AnimationType type, int duration)\nanimate(AnimationType type, int duration, Interpolator interpolator)\nReverse\nAfter executing animate(), the user can rollback the animation by invoking the reverse() method.\nThe reverse method works just like the animate() method, having the same combinations and parameters.\nreverse()\nreverse(AnimationType type, int duration)\nreverse(AnimationType type, int duration, Interpolator interpolator)\nCancel\nIf the user wishes to cancel the on-going animation by any reason, he can do so by invoking the cancel method :\nmorphoOne.cancel();\nupdateView\nLike the method explicitly indicates, the user can update the view associated with the Morpho. This will clear every animation already configured for the given object.\nupdateView(View v) also invokes reset();\nmorphoOne.updateView(newView);\nReset\nIf by any chance the user wants to reset he Morpho and re-build it from scratch, he can do so by invoking the reset() method\nmorphoOne.reset()\nDispose\nLast but not least, if they user wishes to discard the Morphos object, he can invoke the dispose() method, thus clearing and preparing the Morphos' inner variables for garbage collection.\nmorphoOne.dispose();\n","301":"This is library project with a custom view that implements concept of Submit Button (https:\/\/dribbble.com\/shots\/1426764-Submit-Button?list=likes&offset=3) made by Colin Garven.\n###Demo###\n\n###Usage###\n <com.tuesda.submit.SubmitView\n        android:layout_centerInParent=\"true\"\n        android:id=\"@+id\/submit\"\n        android:layout_width=\"200dp\"\n        android:layout_height=\"200dp\" \/>\nmSubmit.setOnProgressStart(new SubmitView.OnProgressStart() {\n            @Override\n            public void progressStart() {\n                \/\/ do something when progress start\n            }\n        });\n        \n        mSubmit.setOnProgressDone(new SubmitView.OnProgressDone() {\n            @Override\n            public void progressDone() {\n                \/\/ do something when progress is done\n            }\n        });\n###public interface###\n\n\n\n\u51fd\u6570\u540d\n\u4f5c\u7528\n\n\n\n\nsetBackColor(int color)\n\u8bbe\u7f6e\u56fe\u6807\u80cc\u666f\u8272\uff0c\u9ed8\u8ba4\u662f\u7eff\u8272(0xff00cd97)\uff0c\u4e0a\u56feDemo\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e3a\u84dd\u8272(0xff0097cd)\n\n\nsetText(String str)\n\u8bbe\u7f6e\u6309\u94ae\u540d\u5b57\uff0c\u9ed8\u8ba4\u662fSubmit\n\n\nreset()\n\u5c06\u6309\u94ae\u91cd\u7f6e\u5230\u521d\u59cb\u72b6\u6001\n\n\nsetProgress(float progress)\n\u8bbe\u7f6e\u6b63\u5728\u6267\u884c\u5de5\u4f5c\u7684\u6267\u884c\u8fdb\u7a0b\n\n\nisProgressDone()\n\u6b63\u5728\u6267\u884c\u5de5\u4f5c\u662f\u5426\u5b8c\u6210\n\n\nsetOnProgressStart(OnProgressStart listener)\n\u8bbe\u7f6eprogress\u5f00\u59cb\u56de\u8c03\n\n\nsetOnProgressDone(OnProgressDone listener)\n\u8bbe\u7f6eprogress\u5b8c\u6210\u56de\u8c03\n\n\n\n","302":"OpenTripPlanner for Android  \nAn Android app for multi-modal trip planning and navigation using any OpenTripPlanner server.\nDownload the app via the Google Play store.\n\nSee more details on the wiki.\nLike hacking things?

There\nis also client of these names hello_client. In module class we configure how we create\nand access these instances.\nhello_client is added using add_type function. It means that injeqt will try to create it\nusing default constructor. We provide that by declaration of Q_INVOKABLE hello_client()\n(Q_INVOKABLE is requires by Qt's meta object system).\nhello_service is added using add_factory function. It means that injeqt will first try to\ncreate a hello_factory object, then it will look for a method of that objet that returns\nhello_service object. It will find Q_INVOKABLE hello_service * create_service() and use it.\nTo be able to create hello_factory injeqt must know about it, so we also add it using add_type\nmethod.\nLast, world_service, is added as a ready object - provided from outside of injeqt scope.\nIn main method list of conifguration modules are passed to newly created injector instance.\nFrom that moment, we can use injector to create and manage our services. Just one line below\nan hello_client instance is required. This is what happens next:\n\ninjeqt looks for dependencies of hello_client and found that it first needs to create hello_factory\ninjeqt creates hello_factory without problems, as it does not have dependencies of its own\ninjeqt adds new instance to object pool\ninjeqt calls hello_factory::create_service() methods and adds its result to object pool\nnow all dependencies of hello_client are available, so new instance of it is created with\ndefault constructor and its added to objec tpool\nall methods of hello_client marked with INJEQT_SET are called with proper objects from pool\nall methods of hello_client marked with INJEQT_INIT are called\nthis instance is returned to caller\nbefore injector is destructed, all methods of hello_client marked with INJEQT_DONE are called\n\n","311":"kinectable_pipe\nkinectable_pipe is a command-line utility that dumps user skeleton data from a Microsoft Kinect device to a standard Unix pipe.\nWhy?\nTo bring Unix-y goodness to the world of Microsoft Kinect programming!\nNo, really, why?\nBecause Kinect programming is a pain in the neck, and by trivializing the device's output into a simple text format, it becomes infinitely easier to digest in the scripting language of your choice.\nThis seems simple to the point of being almost useless\nYes, that's the point.

The simple visualisations provided\n(pie, bar, line, scatter) are as much for demonstration or testing as for wider\nuse. We've tried to connect two great packages without putting too much between\nthem.\nHopefully this means you can quickly create some basic plots of your data or\nget into more sophisticated visualisations without having to fight with\nasynchronous JavaScript or a lot of wrapper code.\nExamples from the repo are also hosted on http:\/\/drsm79.github.com\/Backbone-d3\/\nso you can see the library in action.\nPlotCollection\nAny backbone collection of any backbone model can be used by the plotting view.\nThe collection containing them can have a caption variable set which will be\nrendered (using Markdown if pagedown is available) under the plot. This is all\nthe backbone.d3.PlotCollection does.\nSome simple collections are provided for use with the canned views. If your\ndata maps onto these models\/collections well you can just reuse them. If you\nalready have model\/collections in use you should be able to reuse them\ntrivially.\nPlotView\nPlotView is where the magic happens. It deals with the captioning of plots and\nmakes sure the appropriate actions are taken when data in the collection\nchanges. The PlotView defines how the data is extracted from the collection\n(through the plotdata() method) and how it is rendered to the browser via the\nplot() method.\nThe PlotView is responsible for both formatting and rendering the plot to allow\none collection to be visualised in multiple ways. The view can also hold a\ncaption for the visualisation, overriding the one set on the data collection.\nStreaming\nAs your collection changes so should your visualisation. The change\/add\/remove\ntriggers are bound to the redraw method of the plot view (reset redraws the\nvisualisation from scratch. This triggers a d3 transformation, updating the\nplot in place with your new data. Tasty!\nThe canned plot views\nEach type of visualisation (should be careful about referring to them as\nplots...) is a Backbone view. There are canned views for some common\nvisualisations, or ones we've needed ourselves, that are available in\nindividual files (to minimise what gets loaded) under the Backbone.d3.Canned\nnamespace.\nIf you want to create more interesting visualisations you'll be subclassing the\nPlotView baseclass (please send pull requests if you make something nice!).\n","321":"CMND\nCommand Line Interface Utility for Node.js\nCMND is a package that lets you easily create CLI tools in Node.js using\nidiomatic ES6 syntax (Node 4+). It's also simple to create associated manual\n(help) pages for each command.\nThis module was initially built for Nodal, but\ncan be used anywhere you'd like.\nUsage\nTo use CMND, first install it in your Node project with npm install cmnd --save.\nNext, modify your project's package.json to include:\n\"bin\": {\n  \"mycli\": \".\/cli.js\"\n}\n\nWhere mycli is the intended name of your command in the CLI.\nNow create a file: .\/cli.js and folder .\/commands:\n#!\/usr\/bin\/env node\n\n'use strict';\n\nconst CommandLineInterface = require('cmnd').CommandLineInterface;\nconst CLI = new CommandLineInterface();\n\nCLI.load(__dirname, '.\/commands');\nCLI.run(process.argv.slice(2));\nFinally, populate your commands directory with your commands, here's an example\nfile: .\/commands\/example.js\nmodule.exports = (() => {\n\n  'use strict';\n\n  const Command = require('cmnd').Command;\n\n  class ExampleCommand extends Command {\n\n    constructor() {\n\n      super('example');\n\n    }\n\n    help() {\n\n      return {\n        description: 'An example command',\n        args: ['example_arg1', 'example_arg2'],\n        flags: {flag: 'An example flag'},\n        vflags: {vflag: 'An example verbose flag'}\n      };\n\n    }\n\n    run(args, flags, vflags, callback) {\n\n      \/\/ Run code here.\n      \/\/ To throw an error, use: callback(new Error(msg))\n      \/\/ To optionally return a result, use: callback(null, result)\n\n      callback(null);\n\n    }\n\n  }\n\n  return ExampleCommand;\n\n})();\nCreating manual pages (help)\nView all the commands available to your CLI with mycli help where mycli is\nthe intended name of your command in the CLI. To modify help information,\nchange the return value of the help() method for each command.\nCreating Subcommands\nTo subclass a command (i.e. mycli command_name:sub_name) simply change the contructor()\nmethod in your command to the following:\nconstructor() {\n\n  super('command_name', 'sub_name');\n\n}\n\nRunning your commands\nEach command has a run() method which takes three arguments: args, flags,\nand vflags.\nargs\nargs is the array of arguments, passed before any flags.\ni.e. mycli command alpha beta would populate args with ['alpha', 'beta']\nflags\nflags is an object containing any flags (prefixed with -), where each entry\nis an array of values passed after the flag\ni.e. mycli command -f my flag would populate vflags with {f: ['my', 'flag']}\nvflags\nvflags works identically to flags, but with \"verbose flags\" (prefixed\nwith --).\nAdditional notes\nAll argument arrays passed to args or any flags or vflags options will\nbe separated by spaces, except in the case of quotation marks. Use\nquotation marks to specify an argument with spaces in it.\ni.e. mycli command -f \"argument one\" argument_two\nAcknowledgements\nThanks for checking out the library!

This repo is used to build and maintain the site.\nIf you want to contribute to the improving the site, back-end, front-end etc. Just fork away and submit pull requests.\nSample Implementations\nCheckout the static\/ folder to see some of the sample implementations of Zippopotamus for inspiration and examples for how to implement Zippopotamus API for use in your website etc.\nIf you want to share an implementation, we would love to post example cases of Zippopotamus on our homepage.\nResponse Format\nOn May 1st Zippopotamus changed their JSON response format to work better with international postal codes.  Now we support a one-to-many format service. That is that one zip code may map to many regions, this is common in countries like Spain and France (but not in the US and Germany).\nPostal Code Information\nFor information our postal codes and countries supported, you should check out the zippopotamus crowd-sourcing project.  Here you can download the entire database dump, or fork and add changes that we will incorporate into our DB.\nTechnical Information\nWhat is Zippopotamus built on\nAt the moment the zippopotamus is built on Python, MongoDB and bottle.py framework.\nLocal Testing?\nThe site is configured to run on dotCloud, if you want to test out the web interfaceyou can change the wsgi.py file to include the last commented line, which is used to run the site on your local host.\nSuggestions and Comments?\nHate it? Love it? Open an issue if you have a problem or contact\nJeff Crowell or Samir Ahmed\nAlso, we aren't bottle or python or mongo experts. So if you see a way that we can improve, please let us know. Additionally, if you have examples (translation corrects etc) of using Zippopotamus that you want to share let us know and we can feature your site \/ blog on the homepage.\n","332":"Twitty Twister\nTwitty twister allows you to access twitter-compatible APIs from pure twisted\napps.

Like the extends\ntag, overextends must be the first tag in your template, so it is\nautomatically added to Django's built-in template tags, removing the\nneed to load its tag library in each template.\n","337":"Spans\n\n   \n \n \n\nSpans is a pure Python implementation of PostgreSQL's\nrange types.\nRange types are convenient when working with intervals of any kind. Every time\nyou've found yourself working with date_start and date_end, an interval may have\nbeen what you were actually looking for.\nSpans has successfully been used in production since its first release\n30th August, 2013.\n\nInstallation\nSpans exists on PyPI.\n$ pip install Spans\nDocumentation is hosted on Read the\nDocs.\n\nExample\nImagine you are building a calendar and want to display all weeks that overlaps\nthe current month. Normally you have to do some date trickery to achieve this,\nsince the month's bounds may be any day of the week. With Spans' set-like\noperations and shortcuts the problem becomes a breeze.\nWe start by importing date and daterange\n>>> from datetime import date\n>>> from spans import daterange\nUsing daterange.from_month we can get range representing January in the year\n2000\n>>> month = daterange.from_month(2000, 1)\n>>> month\ndaterange(datetime.date(2000, 1, 1), datetime.date(2000, 2, 1))\nNow we can calculate the ranges for the weeks where the first and last day of\nmonth are\n>>> start_week = daterange.from_date(month.lower, period=\"week\")\n>>> end_week = daterange.from_date(month.last, period=\"week\")\n>>> start_week\ndaterange(datetime.date(1999, 12, 27), datetime.date(2000, 1, 3))\n>>> end_week\ndaterange(datetime.date(2000, 1, 31), datetime.date(2000, 2, 7))\nUsing a union we can express the calendar view.\n>>> start_week.union(month).union(end_week)\ndaterange(datetime.date(1999, 12, 27), datetime.date(2000, 2, 7))\nDo you want to know more? Head over to the\ndocumentation.\n\nUse with Psycopg2\nTo use these range types with Psycopg2 the\nPsycoSpans.\n\nMotivation\nFor a project of mine I started using PostgreSQL's tsrange type and needed\nan equivalent in Python. These range types attempt to mimick PostgreSQL's\nbehavior in every way. Deviating from it is considered as a bug and should be\nreported.\n\nContribute\nI appreciate all the help I can get! Some things to think about:\n\nIf it's a simple fix, such as documentation or trivial bug fix, please file\nan issue or submit a pull request. Make sure to only touch lines relevant to\nthe issue. I don't accept pull requests that simply reformat the code to be\nPEP8-compliant. To me the history of the repository is more important.\nIf it's a feature request or a non-trivial bug, always open an issue first to\ndiscuss the matter. It would be a shame if good work went to waste because a\npull request doesn't fit the scope of this project.\n\nPull requests are credited in the change log which is displayed on PyPI and the\ndocumentaion on Read the Docs.\n","338":"Instadrop\nAutomatically sync your Instagram photos to Dropbox\nA demo application of the Instagram real-time API.\nIt's live! http:\/\/instadrop.appspot.com\nInstallation on Google App Engine\n\nSign up for an App Engine account.\nDownload the App Engine SDK.\nFork and modify our code!

See the spock-android-sample project and\nSpock Framework for more details.\n\n\n\nMocking\n\nObjenesis and cglib do not work with Android. But that\u2019s okay, using dexmaker we can still create\nmock objects in spock fashion. The only difference is instead of your test classes inheriting from\nSpecification, you need to inherit from AndroidSpecification.\n\n\nNote: You can not use mocked automatic getters and setters. Example mocked.getName() will work\nwhere as mocked.name will not. This is due to limitations of Android not having the java.bean\npackage available.\n\n\n\nAnnotations\n\nUseActivity is an field annotation to get access to your Activity during tests. You can even\nprovide bundle arguments by supplying a BundleCreator.\n\n\nEx.\n\n\n\n@UseActivity(MyActivity) def myActivity\n\n\n\nUseApplication is a field annotation that supplies your Application.\n\n\nEx.\n\n\n\n@UseApplication(MyApplication) def myApplication\n\n\n\nWithContext is a field annotation that supplies you with a context. This is not an implementation of\nyour application.\n\n\nEx.\n\n\n\n@WithContext def context\n\n\n\nAll field annotations will be set during the setup fixture.\n\n\n\nOther Notes\n\n\n\nAndroid Studio can not run tests with spaces in the name. This is due to a limitation\nwith how it tells the Android device how to run them. To get around this you can\nname tests without spaces. EX: \"this_is_my_test\" or just run them in gradle with gradle connectedAndroidTest.\n\n\nSpock includes some references to Java packages that are not included in Android. You may need to use\nlintOptions { disable 'InvalidPackage' } to avoid lint failures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLicense\n\n\n\n\nCopyright 2017 Andrew Reitz\n\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n\n\nhttp:\/\/www.apache.org\/licenses\/LICENSE-2.0\n\n\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.\n\n\n\n\n","345":"Expandable-RecyclerView\nA RecyclerView that behaves like an ExpandableListView, also includes a RecyclerView with header\/footer support.\nDownload\nDownload the latest AAR via Maven:\n<dependency>\n  <groupId>com.levelupstudio<\/groupId>\n  <artifactId>expandable-recyclerview<\/artifactId>\n  <version>1.0.1<\/version>\n<\/dependency>\nor Gradle:\ncompile 'com.levelupstudio:expandable-recyclerview:1.0.1'\nLicense\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n   http:\/\/www.apache.org\/licenses\/LICENSE-2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.\n\n","346":"SpringStudy\n\u5bf9Spring\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5b98\u65b9\u6587\u6863\u7684\u7ffb\u8bd1\uff0cSpring\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0cSpring\u6e90\u7801\u7684\u5256\u6790\u3002\u3002\u3002\n","347":"fxosstub\nBuilding an Open Web App on Firefox, step by step.\n\nAll explanations are found\nhere\n","348":"Important Notes\nnode-webcl will be soon superseeded by https:\/\/github.com\/mikeseven\/node-opencl.

This makes it easier to develop higher-level API\nsupports OpenCL 1.1, 1.2, 2.0\nsupport for Nan2 and Node.JS 4\nno dependency on external packages such as node-webgl, which was a huge issue to install for many users\nLots of unit tests\n\nIntroduction\nThis is an implementation of Khronos WebCL specification using NodeJS.\nThis implementation solely relies on OpenCL 1.1 C headers.\nDislaimer\nWhile we are close to the WebCL specification, some features in this code may or may not be available in the final specification. As such, this implementation should be considered for\n\nexperimental development of WebCL\/WebGL content,\nexperimenting with new constructs that may not be available in browsers,\ncoupled with Node.JS awesome capabilities, this software opens the door to non-browser applications (e.g. fast server-side image processing).\n\nThis implementation is not secure nor robust, we will update as the standard progresses in these areas.

This module is used for samples using WebGL interoperability with WebCL.\nIn turns, node-webgl relies on node-glfw that relies on GLFW, GLEW, AntTweakBar, and FreeImage. See node-webgl and node-glfw for instructions on how to install these modules.\n\n\nOpenCL 1.1 must be installed on your machine. Typically, this means your machine has a not too old graphic card (maybe not more than 3 years old) and its latest graphic drivers installed.\n\n\nOn Mac, we recommend using OSX 10.7 \"Lion\" since OSX 10.6 \"Snow Leopard\" only supports OpenCL 1.0 and is buggy.\nOn Windows, use Windows 7. Note that if your machine is 64-bit, you should use node.js 64-bit distribution, not the 32-bit default to avoid mismatch between node libraries and these native dependencies when node-gyp build the modules.\nOn Linux, make sure you use the latest AMD or NVidia drivers. This module has been tested with Ubuntu 10.10, 11.04 and 11.10 64-bit.\nPre-built binaries are available in submodule deps. Don't forget to do:\ngit submodule init\ngit submodule udpate\n\nif you need these binaries.\nInstallation\nMake sure GLEW, GLFW, AntTweakBar, and FreeImage libraries are in your path.\n\n\non Windows, put DLLs in Windows\\System32. Put headers in \\include and static librairies in \\lib for 32-bit libraries (if you use node.js in 32-bit) or \\lib\\x64 (if you use 64-bit node.js).\n\n\non Mac, use homebrew\nbrew install freeimage anttweakbar glfw3 glew\n\n\non Linux use you package manager to install these libraries\n\n\nNow install the usual way:\nnpm install node-webcl\n\nthis will also install https:\/\/github.com\/mikeseven\/node-webgl, https:\/\/github.com\/mikeseven\/node-glfw, https:\/\/github.com\/mikeseven\/node-image, and https:\/\/github.com\/rvagg\/nan.\nIf you want to use the latest code, retrieve each repo (node-webcl, node-webgl, node-glfw, and node-image) from github and simply do\nnode-gyp rebuild\nnpm link\n\nA crash course on WebCL\nWebCL is a JavaScript representation of OpenCL 1.1. It is not a straight mapping of OpenCL C methods but rather an object-oriented representation of OpenCL object model. Knowledge of OpenCL is therefore mandatory to be able to develop WebCL programs. See the Books section and\/or jump directly into Specifications references at the end of this page.\nThere are few steps in creating a WebCL program:\n\nInit WebCL\n\nfind a suitable platform\/device (cl.getPlatform(), cl.getDevices())\ncreate a context (context = cl.createContext())\ncreate a command queue (queue = context.createCommandQueue())\ncompile a program (program = context.createProgram(), program.build())\nset up a kernel and its arguments (kernel = program.createKernel(), kernel.setArg())\nset up commands (queue.enqueueXXX())\n\n\nRun computation\n\nset up kernel arguments (kernel.setArg())\nset up commands (queue.enqueueXXX())\nlaunch the computation (queue.enqueueTask() or queue.enqueueNDRange())\n\n\n\nWhen used with WebGL, WebGL context must be created first because WebCL context is created with sharing the WebGL context. Remember that WebCL allows computations on WebGL buffers. WebCL doesn't do any rendering. By using WebCL and WebGL together, data remains in the device and this avoids expensive data transfer to\/from CPU memory.\nSo the sequence becomes:\n\ninit WebGL\n\ninit buffers\ninit shaders\ninit textures\n\n\ninit WebCL (context = cl.createContext({ sharedObject: gl }))\ninit shared objects (e.g. textures\/array\/pixel\/render buffers)\nlaunch WebGL rendering loop\n\n... execute GL commands\nacquire GL objects (queue.enqueueAcquireGLObjects())\nlaunch CL computation (queue.enqueueNDRange())\nrelease GL objects (queue.enqueueReleaseGLObjects())\n... execute GL commands\n\n\n\nReferences\nSpecifications\n\nKhronos OpenCL specification, http:\/\/www.khronos.org\/registry\/cl\/\nKhronos WebCL working draft, https:\/\/cvs.khronos.org\/svn\/repos\/registry\/trunk\/public\/webcl\/spec\/latest\/index.html\nKhronos WebGL specification, http:\/\/www.khronos.org\/webgl\/\n\nBooks\n\nHeterogeneous Computing with OpenCL, Benedict Gaster, Lee Howes, David R.

Its deployment process follows general process for cocaine applications.\nOnce deployed and started queue accepts data entries pushed into it, stores them among nodes of elliptics cluster its working on, and gives data entries back on consumer request, maintaining entries original order.\nQueue supports fault-tolerance by using data replication and by implementing fault-replay mechanics: consumer must acknowledge processing status of every data entry that it retrieved from the queue - failing to do so will result in entry \"replay\", over and over again up until it'll be confirmed.\n(For further details about how this works internally see TODO: How queue works.)\nAPI\nQueue's API basically consist of three methods: push, peek, ack:\n\npush pushes data entry to the top of the queue\npeek gets data entry from the bottom of the queue\nack confirms that entry has been processed and could be dropped\n\n(Latter two are combined in additional short-circuit method pop.)\nThese methods are implemented in two sets: simple one operates in single queue entries and more complex one operates in multi-entry blocks.\nqueue.push\ndnet_id key;\nsession->exec(&key, \"queue@push\", ioremap::elliptics::data_pointer::from_raw(\"abcd\")).wait();\n\nPushes data entry (\"abcd\") to the queue running under the base name \"queue\" at node responsible for the specified dnet_id.\nThere is no multi-entry variant for this method.\nqueue.peek\ndnet_id key;\nioremap::elliptics::exec_context context = session->exec(\n        &key, \"queue@peek\", ioremap::elliptics::data_pointer()\n        ).get_one().context();\nioremap::elliptics::data_pointer entry_data = context.data();\nioremap::grape::entry_id entry_id = ioremap::grape::entry_id::from_dnet_raw_id(context.src_id());\n\nPeeks data entry from the queue running under the base name \"queue\" at node responsible for the specified dnet_id.\nReturns entry id embedded in src_id field of the response.

This file must be included in deployment tarball along with an app executable (see following section on Deployment).\nqueue.conf must contain configuration for the elliptics client (used to return replies on inbound events) and can include queue configuration options.\nThere is only one configuration option for now:\n\nchunk-max-size (int) - specifies how many entries will contain single chunk in the queue (default value: 10000)\n\nDeployment\nDeployment process of the queue follows general process for cocaine applications. For launching the queue user needs three files:\n\nqueue application file (which is an executable)\nqueue.conf config file (which is also a manifest file)\nqueue.profile execution profile file\n\nqueue app could be taken from the binary package grape-components or built from the sources.

Optionally, it can check whether all the routes of your web application\nare tested.\nWhy to use it\nPediff enables developers to detect entire class of visual problems invisible to\nclassic unit tests and only occasionally catchable by manual review. For more details on the topic\nsee this great talk by Brett Slatkin at Air Mozilla:\nhttps:\/\/air.mozilla.org\/continuous-delivery-at-google\/\nDependencies\n\nUnix-like operating system with Bash shell\nCasperjs 1.1.0 or newer\nImageMagick compare tool\n\nUsage\n\n\nDownload the project to a place of your convenience\n\n\nRename config.js-dist to config.js and set the environments values so that candidate key\npoints to candidate version of your app and current key points to, well... current version of\nyour app. The options object will be passed to Casperjs instance upon every Pediff run.\n\n\nCreate as many task files as needed. They all must be placed inside the tasks\/ subdirectory.\nExample task file:\nmodule.exports = {\n    config: {\n        path: 'PATH\/TO\/RESOURCE'\n        options: {\n            viewportSize: [{width: 1440, height: 900}]\n        },\n        media: {\n            print: false\n        },\n        package: \"homepage\"\n    },\n    execute: function(){\n        this.save('home');\n    }\n};\nEvery task must contain two sections: config and execute. The config part will be merged\nwith global config file before task execution. It serves the purpose of \"creating a sandbox\" for\nthe task: subpage to open, a set of screen resolutions, user agent, media types,\nresponse mocks - things like that.\n###Some config keys explained:\n\npackage is the label under which all the output for given task will be grouped by in the report.\nmedia is the key that enables you to force PhantomJS to render page as different media (ex.\nprint)\n\nThe execute function will be run after the page has been loaded by Casperjs. Everything from\nCasperjs API is acceptable, however you should use\nsave(filename) instead of built in capture method for taking screenshots to make sure the\nfiles are saved in correct directories for comparison.\n\n\nAfter creating your tasks, type:\n$ .\/pediff.sh\ninto terminal and wait for the tool to finish.\nPediff runs every task in a subshell to speed things up. You can limit number of tasks\nto be run parallelly by providing single positive integer as a parameter:\n$ .\/pediff.sh 4\nThis way, tasks will be run in sets of 4 at a time.\n\n\nAt this point index.html file should be sitting in project's report\/ subdirectory. Open it with your\nbrowser and review results.\n\n\nVerbose mode\nWhile working on tasks it is useful to see what is going on during execution.\nYou can force pediff to output more data by setting verbose option to true in your config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n    options: {\n        verbose: true,\n        ...\nReports\nPediff generates convenient reports by default. Just open report\/index.html file with your browser.\n\nExample: Diff view between consecutive deployments of VGTV (difference in video impressions picked up).\nReport's anatomy\nGeneral\n\nOn the left you can see a list of all the tasks executed on your page along with label marking\nlevel of compatibility between the two versions. The list is sorted by number of differences\n(most different first).\nOptionally, you can toggle visibility of matching tasks (100% compability) with \"Show only\ndiffering\" button below.\nBy default, the tool renders lighter (and uglier) jpg images to reduce download times. You can change\nthis behavior with the \"HQ\" button, which forces pediff to load much heavier png images.\nIn the bottom left corner there's \"Test coverage\" link. More on coverage.\n\nTask view\n\nIn the top right corner you can see a list of different screen resulutions that selected task was\nexecuted on.\nIn the central area of report the actual screenshots are displayed. You can switch between\ndiff, current and candidate versions using both arrow keys and mouse clicks (left click forwards,\nright click backwards).\n\nMocks\nSometimes you may want to alter browser state by ensuring a request ends with a certain response.\nYou can do that by providing mocks object to your task's config section:\n\/\/ ...\nconfig: {\n    options: {\n        viewportSize: [{width: 1100, height: 2500}]\n    },\n    mocks: {'modernizer.js': 'modernizr-notouch.js'}\n}\n\/\/ ...\nwhere you map request to mock. Mocks must be located in mocks\/ subdirectory.\nCoverage\nGeneral\nThe tests coverage feature, allows one to easily check, whether all possible subpages of a project are being tested.\nPediff does this by comparing a given set of routes, placed in routes.json, with test paths defined in individual tasks.\nYou can disable the tests coverage feature by setting coverage property of pediff config file to false.\n\/\/ ...\ncoverage: {\n    routes: 'routes.json',\n    skipOptional: true,\n    exceptions: [\n        {\n            route: '',\n            mapTo: ''\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\/\/ ...\nCoverage configuration allows you to set a different path to the routes file (e.g. when this file is generated\nautomatically), and define exceptions by explicitly mapping a path from routes definition to a path in a task file.\nYou may also choose to force checking of routes' optional fragments by setting the skipOptional flag to false.\nReport\nResults of the test coverage check are presented in the pediff report, with an indication of tested viewport sizes,\nmedia and files in which specific tasks are defined. Routes not tested with any tasks will be marked with red color,\nand be included in the total coverage percentage.\nExtending\nCurrently coverage check is possible only for routes defined according to\nBackbone.js routes specification. Support for custom routing setups can be\nadded by extending coverage Route prototype (located in coverage\/route.js), and specifically by overriding the\nfollowing methods: buildVariants, isFragmentOptional, isFragmentVariable. More details can be found in comments\nfor these methods.\n","359":"    \nInline Manifest Webpack Plugin\nThis is a webpack plugin that inline your manifest.js with a script tag to save http request.

Sometimes this is easy.\nSometimes it's not. Dockunit let's you define a set of Docker containers to run your tests against. You can run your\ntest framework of choice in your language of choice on any type of environment. In the past many developers, myself\nincluded, have relied on Travis CI to run tests in environments that aren't setup locally (i.e. PHP 5.2). With\nDockunit you don't need to do this anymore.\nRequirements\n\nOSX or a Linux Distribution (Windows not yet tested or officially supported)\nNode.js\nnpm\nDocker\n\nInstallation\n\nMake sure you have Node.js, Docker, and npm install\nInstall via npm:\n\nnpm install -g dockunit\nUsage\nDockunit relies on Dockunit.json files. Each of your projects should have their own Dockunit.json file.\nDockunit.json defines what test commands should be run on what type of containers for any given project. Here is an\nexample Dockunit.json:\n{\n  \"containers\": [\n    {\n      \"prettyName\": \"PHP 5.2 on Ubuntu\",\n      \"image\": \"user\/my-php-image\",\n      \"beforeScripts\": [],\n      \"testCommand\": \"phpunit\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"prettyName\": \"PHP 5.6 FPM on Ubuntu\",\n      \"image\": \"user\/my-php-image2\",\n      \"beforeScripts\": [],\n      \"testCommand\": \"phpunit\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\ncontainers contains an array of container objects. Each container object can contain the following properties:\n\nprettyName (required) - This is used in output to help you identify your container.\nimage (required) - This is a valid Docker container image located in the Docker registry. We have a number of handy prebuilt Docker images for use in your Dockunit.json files.\nbeforeScripts (optional) - This is a string array of bash scripts to be run in order.\ntestCommand (required) - This is the actual test command to be run on each container i.e. phpunit or qunit.\n\nThe Dockunit command is:\ndockunit <path-to-project-directory> [--du-verbose] [--du-container] [--help] [--version] ...\nNote: sudo is usually required when run within a Linux distribution since Dockunit runs Docker commands which require special permissions.\n\n<path-to-project-directory> (optional) - If you run dockunit in a folder with a Dockunit.json folder, it will detect it\nautomatically.\n[--du-verbose] (optional) - This will print out light verbose Dockunit output. [--du-verbose=2] will output even more verbose Dockunit output.\n[--du-container] (optional) - Run only one container in your Dockunit.json file by specifying the index of that container in the containers array .i.e --du-container=1.\n[--help] (optional) - This will display usage information for the dockunit command.\n[--version] (optional) - This will display the current installed version of Dockunit.\n... - Any additional arguments and options passed to the command will be passed to your test command. For example,\nif you wanted to pass a few extra options to PHPUnit, you could append them to the end of your dockunit command.\n\nYou can simply run dockunit in any folder with a Dockunit.json to run Dockunit.\nDockunit.json Examples\nEach of your projects should have a Dockunit.json file in the project root. You should define your containers to fit\nyour application's unique needs. Here's a few example Dockunit.json files for a variety of different programming languages and\nenvironments.

Sometimes this is easy.\nSometimes it's not. Dockunit let's you define a set of Docker containers to run your tests against. You can run your\ntest framework of choice in your language of choice on any type of environment. In the past many developers, myself\nincluded, have relied on Travis CI to run tests in environments that aren't setup locally (i.e. PHP 5.2). With\nDockunit you don't need to do this anymore.\nRequirements\n\nOSX or a Linux Distribution (Windows not yet tested or officially supported)\nNode.js\nnpm\nDocker\n\nInstallation\n\nMake sure you have Node.js, Docker, and npm install\nInstall via npm:\n\nnpm install -g dockunit\nUsage\nDockunit relies on Dockunit.json files. Each of your projects should have their own Dockunit.json file.\nDockunit.json defines what test commands should be run on what type of containers for any given project. Here is an\nexample Dockunit.json:\n{\n  \"containers\": [\n    {\n      \"prettyName\": \"PHP 5.2 on Ubuntu\",\n      \"image\": \"user\/my-php-image\",\n      \"beforeScripts\": [],\n      \"testCommand\": \"phpunit\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"prettyName\": \"PHP 5.6 FPM on Ubuntu\",\n      \"image\": \"user\/my-php-image2\",\n      \"beforeScripts\": [],\n      \"testCommand\": \"phpunit\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\ncontainers contains an array of container objects. Each container object can contain the following properties:\n\nprettyName (required) - This is used in output to help you identify your container.\nimage (required) - This is a valid Docker container image located in the Docker registry. We have a number of handy prebuilt Docker images for use in your Dockunit.json files.\nbeforeScripts (optional) - This is a string array of bash scripts to be run in order.\ntestCommand (required) - This is the actual test command to be run on each container i.e. phpunit or qunit.\n\nThe Dockunit command is:\ndockunit <path-to-project-directory> [--du-verbose] [--du-container] [--help] [--version] ...\nNote: sudo is usually required when run within a Linux distribution since Dockunit runs Docker commands which require special permissions.\n\n<path-to-project-directory> (optional) - If you run dockunit in a folder with a Dockunit.json folder, it will detect it\nautomatically.\n[--du-verbose] (optional) - This will print out light verbose Dockunit output. [--du-verbose=2] will output even more verbose Dockunit output.\n[--du-container] (optional) - Run only one container in your Dockunit.json file by specifying the index of that container in the containers array .i.e --du-container=1.\n[--help] (optional) - This will display usage information for the dockunit command.\n[--version] (optional) - This will display the current installed version of Dockunit.\n... - Any additional arguments and options passed to the command will be passed to your test command. For example,\nif you wanted to pass a few extra options to PHPUnit, you could append them to the end of your dockunit command.\n\nYou can simply run dockunit in any folder with a Dockunit.json to run Dockunit.\nDockunit.json Examples\nEach of your projects should have a Dockunit.json file in the project root. You should define your containers to fit\nyour application's unique needs. Here's a few example Dockunit.json files for a variety of different programming languages and\nenvironments. Feel free to use any of our prebuilt Docker images in your Dockunit.json files or create your own.\nPHP and WordPress\nDockunit and WordPress work well together. WordPress is backwards compatible with PHP 5.2. It's very difficult to test\napplications on PHP 5.2 without some sort of containerized workflow. Here is an example Dockunit.json file that you\ncan use to test your WordPress plugins in PHP 5.2, 5.6, and PHP 7.0 RC 1 (make sure to replace PLUGIN-FILE.php with your plugins main file):\n{\n  \"containers\": [\n    {\n      \"prettyName\": \"PHP-FPM 5.2 WordPress Latest\",\n      \"image\": \"dockunit\/prebuilt-images:php-mysql-phpunit-wordpress-5.2-fpm\",\n      \"beforeScripts\": [\n        \"service mysql start\",\n        \"wp-install latest\"\n      ],\n      \"testCommand\": \"wp-activate-plugin PLUGIN-FILE.php\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"prettyName\": \"PHP-FPM 5.6 WordPress Latest\",\n      \"image\": \"dockunit\/prebuilt-images:php-mysql-phpunit-wordpress-5.6-fpm\",\n      \"beforeScripts\": [\n        \"service mysql start\",\n        \"wp core download --path=\/temp\/wp --allow-root\",\n        \"wp core config --path=\/temp\/wp --dbname=test --dbuser=root --allow-root\",\n        \"wp core install --url=http:\/\/localhost --title=Test --admin_user=admin --admin_password=12345 --admin_email=test@test.com --path=\/temp\/wp --allow-root\",\n        \"mkdir \/temp\/wp\/wp-content\/plugins\/test\",\n        \"cp -r . \/temp\/wp\/wp-content\/plugins\/test\"\n      ],\n      \"testCommand\": \"wp plugin activate test --allow-root --path=\/temp\/wp\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"prettyName\": \"PHP-FPM 7.0 WordPress Latest\",\n      \"image\": \"dockunit\/prebuilt-images:php-mysql-phpunit-wordpress-7.0-rc-1-fpm\",\n      \"beforeScripts\": [\n        \"service mysql start\",\n        \"wp core download --path=\/temp\/wp --allow-root\",\n        \"wp core config --path=\/temp\/wp --dbname=test --dbuser=root --allow-root\",\n        \"wp core install --url=http:\/\/localhost --title=Test --admin_user=admin --admin_password=12345 --admin_email=test@test.com --path=\/temp\/wp --allow-root\",\n        \"mkdir \/temp\/wp\/wp-content\/plugins\/test\",\n        \"cp -r . \/temp\/wp\/wp-content\/plugins\/test\"\n      ],\n      \"testCommand\": \"wp plugin activate test --allow-root --path=\/temp\/wp\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\nHere is an example Dockunit.json file that you can use to test your WordPress themes in PHP 5.2, 5.6, and PHP 7.0 RC 1:\n{\n  \"containers\": [\n    {\n      \"prettyName\": \"PHP-FPM 5.2 WordPress Latest\",\n      \"image\": \"dockunit\/prebuilt-images:php-mysql-phpunit-wordpress-5.2-fpm\",\n      \"beforeScripts\": [\n        \"service mysql start\",\n        \"wp-install latest\"\n      ],\n      \"testCommand\": \"wp-activate-theme test\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"prettyName\": \"PHP-FPM 5.6 WordPress Latest\",\n      \"image\": \"dockunit\/prebuilt-images:php-mysql-phpunit-wordpress-5.6-fpm\",\n      \"beforeScripts\": [\n        \"service mysql start\",\n        \"wp core download --path=\/temp\/wp --allow-root\",\n        \"wp core config --path=\/temp\/wp --dbname=test --dbuser=root --allow-root\",\n        \"wp core install --url=http:\/\/localhost --title=Test --admin_user=admin --admin_password=12345 --admin_email=test@test.com --path=\/temp\/wp --allow-root\",\n        \"mkdir \/temp\/wp\/wp-content\/themes\/test\",\n        \"cp -r . \/temp\/wp\/wp-content\/themes\/test\"\n      ],\n      \"testCommand\": \"wp theme activate test --allow-root --path=\/temp\/wp\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"prettyName\": \"PHP-FPM 7.0 WordPress Latest\",\n      \"image\": \"dockunit\/prebuilt-images:php-mysql-phpunit-wordpress-7.0-rc-1-fpm\",\n      \"beforeScripts\": [\n        \"service mysql start\",\n        \"wp core download --path=\/temp\/wp --allow-root\",\n        \"wp core config --path=\/temp\/wp --dbname=test --dbuser=root --allow-root\",\n        \"wp core install --url=http:\/\/localhost --title=Test --admin_user=admin --admin_password=12345 --admin_email=test@test.com --path=\/temp\/wp --allow-root\",\n        \"mkdir \/temp\/wp\/wp-content\/themes\/test\",\n        \"cp -r . \/temp\/wp\/wp-content\/themes\/test\"\n      ],\n      \"testCommand\": \"wp theme activate test --allow-root --path=\/temp\/wp\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\nPHP and WordPress Unit Tests\nHere are some more advanced WordPress examples.

The command line tool is designed to work with package.json files so make sure that you have created one for your project first. Checkout jitsu for a quick and easy way to create a package.json.\nFor more information read our blog post at blog.nodejitsu.com.\nCommand-line usage\nUsing require-analyzer from the command line is easy.

This method will use fs.stat() on the path supplied and attempt one of three options:\n\nIf it is a directory that has a package.json, analyze require statements from package.main\nIf it is a directory with no package.json analyze every .js or .coffee file in the directory tree\nIf it is a file, then analyze require statements from that individual file.\n\nLets dive into a quick sample usage:\n  var analyzer = require('require-analyzer');\n\n  var options = {\n    target: 'path\/to\/your\/dependency' \/\/ e.g \/Users\/some-user\/your-package\n    reduce: true\n  };\n\n  var deps = analyzer.analyze(options, function (err, pkgs) {\n    \/\/\n    \/\/ Log all packages that were discovered\n    \/\/\n    console.dir(pkgs);\n  });\n\n  \/\/\n  \/\/ The call the `.analyze()` returns an `EventEmitter` which outputs\n  \/\/ data at various stages of the analysis operation.\n  \/\/\n  deps.on('dependencies', function (raw) {\n    \/\/\n    \/\/ Log the raw list of dependencies (no versions)\n    \/\/\n    console.dir(raw);\n  });\n\n  deps.on('search', function (pkgs) {\n    \/\/\n    \/\/ Log the results from the npm search operation with the current\n    \/\/ active version for each dependency\n    \/\/\n    console.dir(pkgs);\n  });\n\n  deps.on('reduce', function (reduced) {\n    \/\/\n    \/\/ Logs the dependencies after they have been cross-referenced with\n    \/\/ sibling dependencies.

It randomly\nsimulates a user.\nThis code figures out what your application is paying attention to,\nand does it.  It fills in fields with random values.  It finds the\nevents you listen for and fires those events.  It finds internal links\n(like <a href=\"#foo\">) and clicks them.  It's a little like a fuzz\ntester for your app.\nIt has special support for jQuery, and uses source code rewriting to\ndetect what your application is listening for in the absence of\njQuery.  (jQuery leaves evidence on DOM nodes about what is being\nlistened for.)\nYou can use it like so (if you are using jQuery):\n\/\/ This makes something like $('#some-input').val() return random values:\njQuery.fn.val.patch();\n\n\/\/ Now, fiddle around, do 100 random things:\nWalkabout.runManyActions({\n  times: 100\n});\nYou can also give Walkabout hints about what's a valid input; this\nlets it guess application-progressing values more often.\nYou can add data-walkabout-disable=\"1\" to any element to suppress\nactivation of that element or any of its children.\nYou can use data-walkabout-eventname=\"...\" to set attributes on the\nevent that is created, such as data-walkabout-keyup=\"{which: 13}\"\nYou can use data-walkabout-options=\"['a', 'b']\" to give the valid inputs\nfor a field.\nYou can use data-walkabout-edit-value=\"type paste delete move\" to\nhave Walkabout do edit operations inside a textarea or input type=text.  You give a space-separated list of the things to do: type\na key at the cursor (and fire keyup), paste at the cursor (and fire\npaste), delete the selection or delete before or after the cursor, or\nmove the cursor around.\nBookmarklet\nIf you want to try walkabout.js on some random jQuery site, you can\nuse the bookmarklet.  This will\nload Walkabout and also start a simple UI to start the runs.  In\naddition to starting a run it'll also track any uncaught errors and\nany calls to console.warn() or console.error().\nNon-jQuery Support\nThere's some support for working with code that doesn't use jQuery.\nIt might work with other frameworks (by catching their calls to\naddEventListener), but is more intended to work with code that\ndoesn't use a framework.  (Note: if you know equivalent ways to\ndetect what other frameworks are listening for, patches to Walkabout\nwould be welcome, or issues with details and examples that can be\ntested on.)\nThis technique uses code rewriting to capture calls to\n.addEventListener() and .value.  The code can't be weirdly tricky,\nit needs to actually use those literal names -- which is usually fine\nin \"normal\" code, but might not be in fancy or optimized code.  E.g.,\nel[\"addEventListener\"](...) would not be found, nor would\na=\"addEventListener\";el[a](...)\nYou can use Walkabout.rewriteListeners(code) to rewrite the code.\nThe code transformation looks like this:\ndocument.getElementById(\"el\").addEventListener(\"click\", function () {}, true);\nvar value = document.getElementById(\"textarea\").value;\n\n\/\/ Becomes:\nWalkabout.addEventListener(document.getElementById(\"el\"), \"click\", function () {}, true);\nvar value = Walkabout.value(document.getElementById(\"textarea\"));\nAnd to find actions you use Walkabout.findActions(element).\nSee Proxy Server for an option to use this.\nOptions\nBy default Walkabout will only go to links on the current page (i.e.,\nhref=\"#something\").  This is because it will lose its context and\npotentially not load on the next page.  But if you want Walkabout to\nmove to other pages you can use Walkabout.options.anyLocalLinks = true\nOr set it to something like \"\/dir\/\" which will only follow links\nunder \/dir\/.\nIf you use Walkabout.options.loadPersistent = true then it will save\nthe state in localStorage and continue where it left of when another\npage is loaded.\n\nProxy Server\nAn application could include walkabout.js on its own, and if it\ndoesn't use jQuery it could also run Walkabout.rewriteListeners() on\nall its code.  But maybe you don't feel like doing that, maybe you\nwant to try it out without all that work.  Also, by default Walkabout\nwill try to stay on the current page, but in the proxy mode because it\nknows Walkabout will load on each page, it will freely move about the\nsite.\nThere is a proxy server node-proxy.js that makes this easier.  As\nyou might guess, you have to install Node.js to use it.\nThe server expects to receive requests for the website you want to\nactually access.  To do this you have to edit \/etc\/hosts to point\nthe request locally, e.g.:\n127.0.0.1 site-to-test.com\n\nThen when you access http:\/\/site-to-test.com it will connect\nlocally, and the proxy server in turn will forward the request to the\nactual server.  Any HTML responses will have the Walkabout Javascript\nadded, and Javascript will be rewritten.\nNote that it binds to port 80, and so you must run it as root.  This\nisn't awesome, pull requests to drop root welcome.  A tool like\nauthbind also could help.\nWhen you are done you should definitely stop the server, and undo the\n\/etc\/hosts entry.\nNote many live sites seem to notice the proxy, though I don't know\nhow.  My IP got blocked for a week from news.ycombinator.com after\nusing it in my own testing.  Any ideas welcome.\nYou can control the proxy with environmental variables: $PORT for\nthe port to bind to (default 80), $BIND for the interface to bind to\n(default 127.0.0.1; 0.0.0.0 means all interfaces), and $PORT_ALIASES\nwhich looks like domain1:8088;domain2:8080 which lets you proxy from\none port to another (helpful sometimes when you need to proxy to a\nserver running locally).\nLicense\nThis is available under the\nMozilla Public License or the GPL.\nTo Do\nLots of stuff, of course.  But:\n\n\nSometimes the validation options (like data-walkabout-options)\nshould be obeyed, and sometimes they should be ignored.  Obeying\nthem progresses you through the site, disobeying them does some fuzz\ntesting.\n\n\nNot all form controls get triggered, I think.  E.g., checkboxes\ndon't get checked.\n\n\n.val() should figure out better what's a reasonable return value.\nE.g., a textarea returns multi-line strings, a checkbox returns\ntrue\/false.\n\n\nProbably .val() hacking should just go away, and only do \"real\"\nediting of the fields.\n\n\nThe generator could have smarts about what scripts (i.e., action\nsequences) are successful and which are not.  Starting with a\nsuccessful script (that progresses you through the application), and\nthen tweaking that script and increasing randomness at the end of\nthe script.\n\n\nWe could look at code coverage as a score.  Or we could even just\nlook at event coverage - hidden elements often have events bound,\nbut we know they have to be visible to be triggered.  We'd like to\nexplore paths where they are visible.\n\n\nSomething more Gaussian with the values generated.  Like, sometimes\nyou should make a 100 character input.  But maybe not as often as a\n10 character input.  And sometimes a 1 character input.  The values\nshould be biased towards \"fencepost\" values.  E.g., a bug that isn't\ntriggered when you enter 43 is unlike to be triggered by 42, but\nmore likely with 0, -1, or 1000000.\n\n\ndata-walkabout-options should be treated more as additional\nsuggestions instead of the only suggestions.  They represent valid\ninputs that will keep the application going, but invalid inputs are\nstill sometimes interesting.  Still the given options should be\ngenerally preferred when picking random options.\n\n\nOnce a path has shown itself to get us to \"new\" code (via code\ncoverage or that we see new action options) we might want to explore\nthat specific code path further.  Maybe instead of a single random\nnumber seed, we could have a sequence of seeds: [[30491, 10], 50492] meaning use seed 30491 for 10 numbers, then reseed,\nexploring a different path but with the same start as a\nknown-successful path.\n\n\nA corollary of the above: we should have a signature for a set of\nactions, so we can quickly see if a set is unique.\n\n\nConfiguration should be possible externally, not just on attributes\non the DOM.  This would be fairly simple stuff, like:\nWalkabout.options.elements = {\n  \"#name\": {\n    suggest: \"Bob\"\n  },\n};\n\n\n\nSome way of indicating a bug-detector.  Like, you know in some\ncircumstances some element doesn't show when it should or something.\nThese would be functions that would be run in-between actions.\nSimple assertions might work okay, but some tests are expensive or\ntricky.  But in cases when you don't get an \"error\" but have noticed\nthat invalid things can happen (without an exception) a detector\nmight help create a reproducable case.  This could also be a kind of\n\"pause when\" detector.\n\n\nQuickCheck has this notion of making a test as small as possible --\nbasically seeing if you can get to the same error case with a\nsmaller set of actions.  This could be pretty straight forward for\nWalkabout as well.  Though in cases like \"do something, cancel\nsomething, do something again, do error thing\" it might be tricky:\nwe want to trim the first two actions, but trimming either one alone\nwon't make the path possible.  So we have to look for chunks we can\npull out.  With action signatures it might be easier to determine\nsuch chunks.\n\n\nWith code coverage it would be interesting to see which scripts had\n\"changed\" by seeing if any of the code they touch \"changed\".  Then\nthose scripts could be re-run.\n\n\nMaking \"screencaps\" at various points would be interesting.  These\nwould be a freeze of the visible DOM (BrowserMirror-style).  We\ncould do them only when we've determined a path that is\n\"interesting\" (i.e., maybe shows an error), by rerunning from the\nstart.\n\n\nHaving a \"reset app\" hook would be good, so we can truly rerun.\n\n\nCombining signatures, we could try to determine if the app wasn't\ndeterministic despite our efforts.\n\n\nWe should patch Math.random()\n\n\nWe could consider timeouts an actionable thing.  We could keep our\nown fake internal clock (mocking Date and setTimeout\/setInterval),\nand moving it ahead in a predictable way.  We could simulate\nconditions like a computer going to sleep this way.\n\n\nSimulate pagehide and pageview.\n\n\nSimulate WebAPIs,\nat least the non-deterministic ones.  This involves mocking each one\nout (except event ones, which work kind of like other events).\n\n\nMaybe hook up to\nWebDriver so we\ncan issue events that we aren't generally allowed to issue.\n.dispatchEvent() doesn't work with keyboard events, for instance.\nOTOH, we could also reimplement the event dispatch process.\n\n\nPut in touch events on mobile, and suppress hover events.\n\n\n","364":"Entwine \u2013 Support for Concrete UI style programming in jQuery\nBy Hamish Friedlander, with thanks to SilverStripe\nEntwine tries to provide a new model of code organisation \u2013 a replacement for Object Oriented programming that is\nfocused on adding functions to groups of DOM elements based on the structure and contents of those DOM elements. It\u2019s a\nmerging of the model and view layer that initially seems weird, but can give very powerful results.\nWe\u2019re standing on the shoulders of giants here \u2013 combining ideas from Prototype\u2019s behaviour & lowpro and jQuery\u2019s effen\n& livequery (who themselves stole ideals from Self\u2019s Morphic UI and others), but extending & combining the concepts\npresented in those tools to provide a complete alternative to traditional OO concepts \u2013 self-aware methods, inheritance,\npolymorphisim and namespacing without a single class definition.\nRequirements\nCurrently Entwine layers itself on top of jQuery. Any patch level of jQuery from 1.7 through 1.11 or 2.0 through 2.1 should work.\nBecause we patch some internal jQuery APIs there can be a delay between a new version of jQuery being released\nand Entwine providing support.\nGetting Started\n\nWalk through the Tutorial\nWatch the Screencast (shot during a introductory developer meeting at SilverStripe)\nJoin the Google Group and let us know what you think, or what other features you\u2019d like to see\n\nName change\njQuery Entwine used to be called jQuery Concrete. The name was changed to avoid confusion with another product. The concrete function remains as an alias, but all new code should use entwine\nBasic use\nFirst intro\nTo attach methods to DOM nodes, call the `entwine` function on a jQuery selector object, passing a hash listing the method names and bodys\n\n  $('div').entwine({\n    foo: function(..){..},\n    bar: function(..){..}\n  });\n\nYou can then call those methods on any jQuery object.\n\n  $('#a').foo();\n\nAny elements in the jQuery selection that match the selector used during definition (\u2018div\u2019 in this example) will have foo called with that element\nset as this. Any other objects are skipped. The return value will be the return value of foo() for the last matched DOM object in the set\nA proper example\nGiven this DOM structure:\n\n  <body>\n    <div class=\"internal_text\">Internal text<\/div>\n    <div class=\"attribute_text\" rel=\"Attribute text\"><\/div>\n    <div>Nonsense<\/div>\n  <\/body>\n\nAnd this entwine definition\n\n  $('.internal_text').entwine({\n    foo: function(){ console.log(this.text()); }\n  });\n  $('.attribute_text').entwine({\n    foo: function(){ console.log(this.attr('rel')); }\n  });\n\nThen this call\n\n  $('div').foo();\n\nWill log this to the console\n\n  Internal text\n  Attribute text  \n\nLimitations\nWhen defining methods, the jQuery object that entwine is called on must be a plain selector, without context. These examples will not work\n\n  $('div', el).entwine(...)\n  $([ela, elb, elc]).entwine(...)\n  $('<div id=\"a\"><\/div>').entwine(...)\n\nLive\nThe definitions you provide are not bound to the elements that match at definition time. You can declare behaviour prior to the DOM existing in any\nform (i.e. prior to DOMReady) and later calls will function correctly.\nSelector specifity\nWhen there are two definitions for a particular method on a particular DOM node, the function with the most specific selector is used. \nSpecifity is calculated as defined by the CSS 2\/3 spec. This can be seen as subclassing applied to behaviour.\nAnother example. Given this DOM structure\n\n  <body>\n    <div>Internal text<\/div>\n    <div class=\"attribute_text\" rel=\"Attribute text\"><\/div>\n    <div>Nonsense<\/div>\n  <\/body>\n\nAnd this entwine definition\n\n  $('div').entwine({\n    foo: function(){ console.log(this.text()); }\n  });\n  $('.attribute_text').entwine({\n    foo: function(){ console.log(this.attr('rel')); }\n  });\n\nThen this call\n\n  $('div').foo();\n\nWill log this to the console\n\n  Internal text\n  Attribute text\n  Nonsense\n\nEvents\nIf you declare a function with a name starting with \u2018on\u2019, then instead of defining that function, it will be bound to an event of that\nname. Just like other functions this binding will be live, and only the most specific definition will be used\n\n  <head>\n    <script type='text\/javascript'>\n      \/* No need for onready wrapper. Events are bound as needed *\/\n      $('div').entwine({\n        onclick: function(){ this.css({backgroundColor: 'blue'}); }\n      });\n      $('.green').entwine({\n        onclick: function(){ this.css({color: 'green'}); }\n      });\n    <\/script>\n  <body>\n    <div>Background will turn blue when clicked on<\/div>\n    <div>Will also have blue background when clicked on<\/div>\n    <div class='green'>Will have green text when clicked on. Background color will not change<\/div>\n  <\/body>\n\nConstructors \/ Destructors\nDeclaring a function with the name `onmatch` will create a behavior that is called on each object when it matches. Likewise, `onunmatch` will\nbe called when an object that did match this selector stops matching it (because it is removed, or because you\u2019ve changed its properties).\nNote that an onunmatch block must be paired with an onmatch block \u2013 an onunmatch without an onmatch in the same entwine definition block is illegal\nLike other functions, only the most specific definition will be used. However, because property changes are not atomic, this may not work as you\nexpect.\nNamespaces\nTo avoid name clashes, to allow multiple bindings to the same event, and to generally seperate a set of functions from other code you can use namespaces\n\n  $.entwine('foo.bar', function($){\n    $('div').entwine({\n      baz: function(){}\n    });\n  });\n\nYou can then call these functions like this:\n\n  $('div').entwine('foo.bar').baz()\n\nNamespaced functions work just like regular functions (`this` is still set to a matching DOM Node). However, specifity is calculated per namespace.\nThis is particularly useful for events, because given this:\n\n  $('div').entwine({\n    onclick: function(){ this.css({backgroundColor: 'blue'}); }\n  });\n  \n  $.entwine('foo', function($){\n    $('div').entwine({\n      onclick: function(){ this.css({color: 'green'}); }\n    });\n  });\n\nClicking on a div will change the background and foreground color.\nThis is particularly important when writing reusable code, since otherwise you can\u2019t know before hand whether your event handler will be called or not\nAlthough a namespace can be any string, best practise is to name them with dotted-identifier notation.\nNamespaces and scope (or What the hell\u2019s up with that ugly function closure)\nInside a namespace definition, functions remember the namespace they are in, and calls to other functions will be looked up inside that namespace first. \nWhere they don\u2019t exist, they will be looked up in the base namespace\n\n  $.entwine('foo', function($){\n    $('div').entwine({\n      bar: function() { this.baz(); this.qux(); }\n      baz: function() { console.log('baz'); }\n    })\n  })\n  \n  $('div').entwine({\n    qux: function() { console.log('qux'); }\n  })\n\nWill print baz, qux to the console\nNote that \u2018exists\u2019 means that a function is declared in this namespace for any selector, not just a matching one. Given the dom\n\n  <div>Internal text<\/div>\n\nAnd the entwine definitions\n\n  $.entwine('foo', function($){\n    $('div').entwine({\n      bar: function() { this.baz(); }\n    });\n    $('span').entwine({\n      baz: function() { console.log('a'); }\n    });\n  })\n  \n  \n  $('div').entwine({\n    baz: function() { console.log('b'); }\n  })\n\nThen doing $(\u2018div\u2019).bar(); will not display b. Even though the span rule could never match a div, because baz is defined for some rule in the foo namespace, the base namespace will never be checked\nNesting namespace blocks\nYou can also nest declarations. In this next example, we\u2019re defining the functions $().entwine(\u2018zap\u2019).bar() and $().entwine(\u2018zap.pow\u2019).baz()\n\n  $.entwine('zap', function($){\n    $('div').entwine({\n      bar: function() { .. }\n    })\n    $.entwine('pow', function($){\n      $('div').entwine({\n        baz: function() { .. }\n      })\n    })\n  })\n\nCalling to another namespace (and forcing base)\nInside a namespace, namespace lookups are by default relative to the current namespace.\nIn some situations (such as the last example) you may want to force using the base namespace. In this case you can call entwine with the first argument being the base namespace code \u2018.\u2019. For example, if the first definition in the previous example was\n\n  $.entwine('foo', function($){\n    $('div').entwine({\n      bar: function() { this.entwine('.').baz(); }\n    })\n  })\n\nThen b would be output to the console.\nUsing\nSometimes a block outside of a namespace will need to refer to that namespace repeatedly. By passing a function to the entwine function, you can change the looked-up namespace\n\n  $.entwine('foo', function($){\n    $('div').entwine({\n      bar: function() { console.log('a'); }\n    })\n  })\n  \n  $('div').entwine('foo', function(){\n    this.bar();\n    this.bar();\n    this.bar();\n  });\n\nThis equivalent to \/with\/ in javascript, and just like \/with\/, care should be taken to only use this construct in situations that merit it.\nTests\nSpecs are written using the awesome JSpec library.  You can run them in two ways\nAd-hoc\nOpen the file `spec\/spec.html` in any modern browser\nContinuous testing\nJSpec has a command line client which can be used for continuous testing. Make sure ruby is installed and enabled the Gemcutter gem hosting service, like so:\n\n\tsudo gem install gemcutter\n    sudo gem tumble\n\nThen install the jspec binary:\n\n    sudo gem install jspec\n\nThe JSpec command line tool should now be installed. This command will re-run the specs whenever you edit a file:\n\n    jspec spec\/spec.html -p src,spec\n\nLicense\nCopyright \u00a9 2009 Hamish Friedlander (hamish@silverstripe.com) and SilverStripe Limited (www.silverstripe.com).

Async apps create\nchallenges like keeping track of the async status and dealing with async errors.\nWhile it is possible to build an app this way using\nredux-thunk\nand\/or\nredux-promise\nit tends to bloat the app and it makes unit testing needlessly verbose\nredux-await tries to solve all of these problems by keeping track of async payloads by means\nof a middleware and a reducer keeping track of payload properties statuses. Let's walk\nthrough the development of a TODO app (App 1) that starts without any async and then needs to\nstart converting action from sync to async. We'll first try only using redux-thunk to solve\nthis (App 2), and then see how to solve this with redux-await (App 3)\nFor the first version of the app we're going to store the todos in localStorage. Here's a simple way we would do it:\nApp1 demo\nApp 1\nimport React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\nimport { Provider, connect } from 'react-redux';\nimport {

{\n    return { ...state, isAppSynced: true, todos: action.payload.todos };\n  }\n  if (action.type === ADD_TODO) {\n    return { ...state, isAppSynced: false, todos:

The todosReducer didn't need to have a single line changed!\nNote that this is 107 LOC compared to app2's 125 LOC\nSome pitfalls to watch out for\nYou must either use this modules connect or manually spread the await part of the tree over\nmapStateToProps, you can also choose to name it something other than await and spread that\nyourself too.\nredux-await will name the statuses and errors prop the same as the payload prop so try to be\nas descriptive as possible when naming payload props since any payload props collision will\noverwrite the statuses\/errors value. For a CRUD app don't always name it something like\nrecords because when you're loading users.records the app will also think you're loading\ntodos.records\nHow it works:\nThe middleware checks to see if the AWAIT_MARKER was set on the action\nand if it was then dispatches three events with a [AWAIT_META_CONTAINER]\nproperty on the meta property of the action.\nThe reducer listens for actions with a meta of [AWAIT_META_CONTAINER] and\nwhen found will set the await property of the state accordingly.\n","367":"Conductor.js\n\nConductor.js is a library for creating sandboxed, re-usable apps that\ncan be embedded inside a host application.\nThe advantage of using Conductor.js over a standard <iframe> is that\nit uses a well-defined set of events that allow the app and its host\nenvironment to communicate. Because of this, apps from different vendors\ncan be embedded securely, yet still interact in meaningful ways.\nUnderstanding Conductor.js\nTo understand the benefit of architecting your application using\nConductor, let's look at an example use case.\nImagine that you are authoring a next-generation banking web\napplication. When your customers visit their account online, you would\nlike to present them with a list of their most recent transactions:\n\nThis is fine, but is the same as every other bank. You, being a\nnext-generation, technology-driven bank, want to make this data more\nmeaningful to your customers. Most transactions have some metadata\nassociated with them. What if you could allow merchants to customize how\ntheir transactions appeared?\n\nObviously, you could write custom code for each merchant that might have\na transaction go through your bank. But there are many merchants in the\nworld, and you would most likely only have the resources to customize\nthe most popular.\nThe better option is to have each merchant write and maintain their own\ntransaction card. But how do you run that code in a way that doesn't\nmake your customers' private financial data vulnerable to attack?\nRunning the code directly is out of the question. Normally, you might\njust create an <iframe> for each item in the transaction. That's fine,\nbut how do provide information about the transaction to each transaction\ncard? And what if you want to get information out of the card?\nFor example, imagine we wanted to group transactions by type. Instead of\nguessing, we could ask each transaction what category it belongs to,\nthen show the user only travel-related transactions, for example.\nConductor.js allows you to define interfaces between a host environment\nand the cards that run inside of it, without having to write messy and\nbrittle transports over postMessage.\nCards are also designed to be run on the server, so they can be indexed\nand otherwise manipulated without having to create a memory- and\nCPU-intensive virtual browser.\nAnd, because cards are run inside either iframes or Web Workers, they\ncannot get access to any data that is not explicitly provided.\nThe above example is just one use for Conductor.js. There are many\ndifferent scenarios where being able to embed secure, third-party code\ncan allow you to build a platform of re-usable components that can\ninteract with their host environment.\nAuthoring Conductor.js Cards\nA card is an application that can be embedded in a parent environment\nusing Conductor.js. The entry point to a card is an HTML page that loads\nConductor.js.\nAt its most basic, your card should call the Conductor.card method.\nThe object passed to Conductor.card defines the behavior of the card,\nand contains callbacks and other hooks that will be invoked in response\nto requests from the containing environment.\nFor example, the activate hook is invoked automatically once all\ndependencies have finished loading, and communication with the parent\nenvironment has been set up:\nConductor.card({\n  activate: function() {\n    this.alert(\"Hello!\")\n  }\n});\nLoading Dependencies\nA card can load additional javascript dependencies by using the\nConductor.require method:\nConductor.require('alert.js');\nNote that files loaded via Conductor.require are loaded\nasynchronously. That means that, assuming the Model class was\ndefined in models.js, this would not work:\nConductor.require('models.js');\nvar person = new Model();\nMake sure you only access dependencies once the card's activate method\nhas been called:\nConductor.require('alert.js');\n\nfunction createModel() {\n  var person = new Model();\n}\n\nConductor.card({\n  activate: function() {\n    createModel();\n  }\n});\nYou can include CSS files in your card using the Conductor.requireCSS method:\nConductor.requireCSS('card.css');\nThe path is relative to the card.\nTutorial\nLearn more about authoring cards in the tutorial.\nBuild Tools\nConductor.js uses Grunt to automate building and\ntesting.\nSetup\nBefore you use any of the commands below, make sure you have\ninstalled node.js, which includes npm, the node package manager.\nIf you haven't before, install the grunt CLI tool:\n$ npm install -g grunt-cli\nThis will put the grunt command in your system path, allowing it to be\nrun from any directory.\nNext, install Conductor's dependencies:\n$ npm install\nThis will install all of the packages that Conductor's Gruntfile relies\non into the local node_modules directory.\nBuilding\nConductor is available as either as an AMD module, or as a more\ntraditional distribution that exports the global variable Conductor.\nTo build both versions, run:\ngrunt build\n\nYou can find the built versions of the library in the dist directory.\nTests\nRun the Conductor tests by starting a test server:\ngrunt server\n\nOnce the server is running, visit http:\/\/localhost:8000 in your\nbrowser. Conductor will automatically be rebuilt if you make any changes\nto its constituent files while the server is running.\n","368":"\n\n\n\nStoring settings in the database\nNot all settings belong in settings.py, as it has some particular\nlimitations:\n\n\nSettings are project-wide. This not only requires apps to clutter up\nsettings.py, but also increases the chances of naming conflicts.\nSettings are constant throughout an instance of Django. They cannot be\nchanged without restarting the application.\nSettings require a programmer in order to be changed. This is true even\nif the setting has no functional impact on anything else.\n\n\nMany applications find need to overcome these limitations, and dbsettings\nprovides a convenient way to do so.\nThe main goal in using this application is to define a set of placeholders that\nwill be used to represent the settings that are stored in the database. Then,\nthe settings may be edited at run-time using the provided editor, and all Python\ncode in your application that uses the setting will receive the updated value.\n\nRequirements\n\n\nDbsettings\nPython\nDjango\n\n\n\n==0.10\n3.4 - 3.5\n1.7 - 1.10\n\n3.2 - 3.3\n1.7 - 1.8\n\n2.7\n1.7 - 1.10\n\n==0.9\n3.4 - 3.5\n1.7 - 1.9\n\n3.2 - 3.3\n1.7 - 1.8\n\n2.7\n1.7 - 1.9\n\n==0.8\n3.2\n1.5 - 1.8\n\n2.7\n1.4 - 1.8\n\n2.6\n1.4 - 1.6\n\n==0.7\n3.2\n1.5 - 1.7\n\n2.7\n1.3 - 1.7\n\n2.6\n1.3 - 1.6\n\n==0.6\n3.2\n1.5\n\n2.6 - 2.7\n1.3 - 1.5\n\n<=0.5\n2.6 - 2.7\n1.2* - 1.4\n\n\n\n* Possibly version below 1.2 will work too, but not tested.\n\nInstallation\nTo install the dbsettings package, simply place it anywhere on your\nPYTHONPATH.\n\nProject settings\nIn order to setup database storage, and to let Django know about your use of\ndbsettings, simply add it to your INSTALLED_APPS setting, like so:\nINSTALLED_APPS = (\n    ...\n    'dbsettings',\n    ...\n)\n\nIf your Django project utilizes sites framework, all setting would be related\nto some site. If sites are not present, settings won't be connected to any site\n(and sites framework is no longer required since 0.8.1).\nYou can force to do (not) use sites via DBSETTINGS_USE_SITES = True \/ False\nconfiguration variable (put it in project's settings.py).\nBy default, values stored in database are limited to 255 characters per setting.\nYou can change this limit with DBSETTINGS_VALUE_LENGTH configuration variable.\nIf you change this value after migrations were run, you need to manually alter\nthe dbsettings_setting table schema.\n\nURL Configuration\nIn order to edit your settings at run-time, you'll need to configure a URL to\naccess the provided editors. You'll just need to add a single line, defining\nthe base URL for the editors, as dbsettings has its own URLconf to handle\nthe rest. You may choose any location you like:\nurlpatterns = patterns('',\n    ...\n    (r'^settings\/', include('dbsettings.urls')),\n    ...\n)\n\n\nA note about caching\nThis framework utilizes Django's built-in cache framework, which is used to\nminimize how often the database needs to be accessed. During development,\nDjango's built-in server runs in a single process, so all cache backends will\nwork just fine.\nMost productions environments, including mod_python, FastCGI or WSGI, run multiple\nprocesses, which some backends don't fully support. When using the simple\nor locmem backends, updates to your settings won't be reflected immediately\nin all workers, causing your application to ignore the new changes.\nNo other backends exhibit this behavior, but since simple is the default,\nmake sure to specify a proper backend when moving to a production environment.\nAlternatively you can disable caching of settings by setting\nDBSETTINGS_USE_CACHE = False in settings.py. Beware though: every\naccess of any setting will result in database hit.\n\nUsage\nThese database-backed settings can be applied to any model in any app, or even\nin the app itself. All the tools necessary to do so are available within the\ndbsettings module. A single import provides everything you'll need:\nimport dbsettings\n\n\nDefining a group of settings\nSettings are be defined in groups that allow them to be referenced together\nunder a single attribute. Defining a group uses a declarative syntax similar\nto that of models, by declaring a new subclass of the Group class and\npopulating it with values.\nclass ImageLimits(dbsettings.Group):\n    maximum_width = dbsettings.PositiveIntegerValue()\n    maximum_height = dbsettings.PositiveIntegerValue()\n\nYou may name your groups anything you like, and they may be defined in any\nmodule. This allows them to be imported from common applications if applicable.\n\nDefining individual settings\nWithin your groups, you may define any number of individual settings by simply\nassigning the value types to appropriate names. The names you assign them to\nwill be the attribute names you'll use to reference the setting later, so be\nsure to choose names accordingly.\nFor the editor, the default description of each setting will be retrieved from\nthe attribute name, similar to how the verbose_name of model fields is\nretrieved. Also like model fields, however, an optional argument may be provided\nto define a more fitting description. It's recommended to leave the first letter\nlower-case, as it will be capitalized as necessary, automatically.\nclass EmailOptions(dbsettings.Group):\n    enabled = dbsettings.BooleanValue('whether to send emails or not')\n    sender = dbsettings.StringValue('address to send emails from')\n    subject = dbsettings.StringValue(default='SiteMail')\n\nFor more descriptive explanation, the help_text argument can be used. It\nwill be shown in the editor.\nThe default argument is very useful - it specify an initial value of the\nsetting.\nIn addition, settings may be supplied with a list of available options, through\nthe use of of the choices argument. This works exactly like the choices\nargument for model fields, and that of the newforms ChoiceField.\nThe widget used for a value can be overriden using the widget keyword. For example:\npayment_instructions = dbsettings.StringValue(\n    help_text=\"Printed on every invoice.\",\n    default=\"Payment to Example XYZ\\nBank name here\\nAccount: 0123456\\nSort: 01-02-03\",\n    widget=forms.Textarea\n)\n\nA full list of value types is available later in this document, but the process\nand arguments are the same for each.\n\nAssigning settings\nOnce your settings are defined and grouped properly, they must be assigned to a\nlocation where they will be referenced later. This is as simple as instantiating\nthe settings group in the appropriate location. This may be at the module level\nor within any standard Django model.\nGroup instance may receive one optional argument: verbose name of the group.\nThis name will be displayed in the editor.\nemail = EmailOptions()\n\nclass Image(models.Model):\n    image = models.ImageField(upload_to='\/upload\/path')\n    caption = models.TextField()\n\n    limits = ImageLimits('Dimension settings')\n\nMultiple groups may be assigned to the same module or model, and they can even\nbe combined into a single group by using standard addition syntax:\noptions = EmailOptions() + ImageLimits()\n\nTo separate and tag settings nicely in the editor, use verbose names:\noptions = EmailOptions('Email') + ImageLimits('Dimesions')\n\n\nDatabase setup\nA single model is provided for database storage, and this model must be\ninstalled in your database before you can use the included editors or the\npermissions that will be automatically created. This is a simple matter of\nrunning manage.py syncdb or manage.py migrate now that your settings\nare configured.\nThis step need only be repeate when settings are added to a new application,\nas it will create the appropriate permissions. Once those are in place, new\nsettings may be added to existing applications with no impact on the database.\n\nUsing your settings\nOnce the above steps are completed, you're ready to make use of database-backed\nsettings.\n\nEditing settings\nWhen first defined, your settings will default to None (or False in\nthe case of BooleanValue), so their values must be set using one of the\nsupplied editors before they can be considered useful (however, if the setting\nhad the default argument passed in the constructor, its value is already\nuseful - equal to the defined default).\nThe editor will be available at the URL configured earlier.\nFor example, if you used the prefix of 'settings\/', the URL \/settings\/\nwill provide an editor of all available settings, while \/settings\/myapp\/\nwould contain a list of just the settings for myapp.\nURL patterns are named: 'site_settings' and 'app_settings', respectively.\nThe editors are restricted to staff members, and the particular settings that\nwill be available to users is based on permissions that are set for them. This\nmeans that superusers will automatically be able to edit all settings, while\nother staff members will need to have permissions set explicitly.\n\nAccessing settings in Python\nOnce settings have been assigned to an appropriate location, they may be\nreferenced as standard Python attributes. The group becomes an attribute of the\nlocation where it was assigned, and the individual values are attributes of the\ngroup.\nIf any settings are referenced without being set to a particular value, they\nwill default to None (or False in the case of BooleanValue, or\nwhatever was passed as default). In the\nfollowing example, assume that EmailOptions were just added to the project\nand the ImageLimits were added earlier and already set via editor.\n>>> from myproject.myapp import models\n\n# EmailOptions are not defined\n>>> models.email.enabled\nFalse\n>>> models.email.sender\n>>> models.email.subject\n'SiteMail'  # Since default was defined\n\n# ImageLimits are defined\n>>> models.Image.limits.maximum_width\n1024\n>>> models.Image.limits.maximum_height\n768\n\nThese settings are accessible from any Python code, making them especially\nuseful in model methods and views. Each time the attribute is accessed, it will\nretrieve the current value, so your code doesn't need to worry about what\nhappens behind the scenes.\ndef is_valid(self):\n    if self.width > Image.limits.maximum_width:\n        return False\n    if self.height > Image.limits.maximum_height:\n        return False\nreturn True\n\nAs mentioned, views can make use of these settings as well.\nfrom myproject.myapp.models import email\n\ndef submit(request):\n\n    ...\n    # Deal with a form submission\n    ...\n\n    if email.enabled:\n        from django.core.mail import send_mail\n    send_mail(email.subject, 'message', email.sender, [request.user.email])\n\nSettings can be not only read, but also written. The admin editor is more\nuser-friendly, but in case code need to change something:\nfrom myproject.myapp.models import Image\n\ndef low_disk_space():\n    Image.limits.maximum_width = Image.limits.maximum_height = 200\n\nEvery write is immediately commited to the database and proper cache key is deleted.\n\nA note about model instances\nSince settings aren't related to individual model instances, any settings that\nare set on models may only be accessed by the model class itself. Attempting to\naccess settings on an instance will raise an AttributeError.\n\nValue types\nThere are several various value types available for database-backed settings.\nSelect the one most appropriate for each individual setting, but all types use\nthe same set of arguments.\n\nBooleanValue\nPresents a checkbox in the editor, and returns True or False in Python.\n\nDurationValue\nPresents a set of inputs suitable for specifying a length of time. This is\nrepresented in Python as a timedelta object.\n\nFloatValue\nPresents a standard input field, which becomes a float in Python.\n\nIntegerValue\nPresents a standard input field, which becomes an int in Python.\n\nPercentValue\nSimilar to IntegerValue, but with a limit requiring that the value be\nbetween 0 and 100. In addition, when accessed in Python, the value will be\ndivided by 100, so that it is immediately suitable for calculations.\nFor instance, if a myapp.taxes.sales_tax was set to 5 in the editor,\nthe following calculation would be valid:\n>>> 5.00 * myapp.taxes.sales_tax\n0.25\n\n\nPositiveIntegerValue\nSimilar to IntegerValue, but limited to positive values and 0.\n\nStringValue\nPresents a standard input, accepting any text string up to 255\n(or DBSETTINGS_VALUE_LENGTH) characters. In\nPython, the value is accessed as a standard string.\n\nDateTimeValue\nPresents a standard input field, which becomes a datetime in Python.\nUser input will be parsed according to DATETIME_INPUT_FORMATS setting.\nIn code, one can assign to field string or datetime object:\n# These two statements has the same effect\nmyapp.Feed.next_feed = '2012-06-01 00:00:00'\nmyapp.Feed.next_feed = datetime.datetime(2012, 6, 1, 0, 0, 0)\n\n\nDateValue\nPresents a standard input field, which becomes a date in Python.\nUser input will be parsed according to DATE_INPUT_FORMATS setting.\nSee DateTimeValue for the remark about assigning.\n\nTimeValue\nPresents a standard input field, which becomes a time in Python.\nUser input will be parsed according to TIME_INPUT_FORMATS setting.\nSee DateTimeValue for the remark about assigning.\n\nImageValue\n(requires PIL or Pillow imaging library to work)\nAllows to upload image and view its preview.\nImageValue has optional upload_to keyword, which specify path\n(relative to MEDIA_ROOT), where uploaded images will be stored.\nIf keyword is not present, files will be saved directly under\nMEDIA_ROOT.\n\nPasswordValue\nPresents a standard password input. Retain old setting value if not changed.\n\nSetting defaults for a distributed application\nDistributed applications often have need for certain default settings that are\nuseful for the common case, but which may be changed to suit individual\ninstallations. For such cases, a utility is provided to enable applications to\nset any applicable defaults.\nLiving at dbsettings.utils.set_defaults, this utility is designed to be used\nwithin the app's management.py. This way, when the application is installed\nusing syncdb\/migrate, the default settings will also be installed to the database.\nThe function requires a single positional argument, which is the models\nmodule for the application.

No need to change any of your view logic.\n###Forms\nSimilarly with the FPFileField for models, the filepicker django library defines a FPFileField for forms as well, that likewise serves as a drop-in replacement for the standard django FileField. There is also the FPUrlField if you want to store the Filepicker.io URL instead\n###Middleware\nAlso included is a middleware library that will take any Filepicker.io urls passed to the server, download the contents, and place the result in request.FILES. This way, you can keep your backend code for handling file uploads the same as before while adding all the front-end magic that Filepicker.io provides\nIf you have any questions, don't hesitate to reach out at contact@filepicker.io.

Its goals are to:\n\nProvide a management API for UNIX-like systems to query and modify\nsystem resources\nMake managing new kinds of resources very simple; in particular, there is\nno need to write native code to add new providers and they can be\narbitrary scripts that adhere to one of a number of simple calling\nconventions\nExpress both current state and desired state in a simple, unified form\nGuarantee that all changes are done idempotently by enforcing desired\nstate only when changes are needed\nHave a very small default footprint that enables use of libral in\nresource-constrained environments such as devices or containers\nBe versatile enough to serve as the basis of more extensive configuration\nmanagement systems, such as\nPuppet, without being directly\ndependent on any one of them.\n\nGetting in touch\n\nMailing list: libral\nIRC: irc.freenode.net:#libral\n\nBuilding and installation\nIf you just want to quickly try out libral, you can download a\nprecompiled tarball\n(GPG signature)\nthat should work on any Linux machine that has glibc 2.12 or later. (It\nmight actually work with glibc 2.8 or later.) If you succeed in that, please\nlet us know.\nWe have reports of the precompiled binaries working on 64-bit Fedora 21-25,\nRHEL 5-7 (and related distributions like CentOS), Debian 6-9,\nUbuntu 10.04-16.10, and SLES 11-12. The binaries will not work on\n32-bit and pre-glibc 2.8 systems: RHEL 4, SLES 10, ...\nIn case you do need to build from source, which is not required for\nprovider development, only if you want to work on the core libral library,\nthis document contains instructions on building libral.\nDocker\nYou can also try out libral in the context of a Docker container. The\nDockerfile in the repository allows for building an image quickly based\non the above mentioned precompiled tarball.\ndocker build -t puppet\/libral .\n\nRunning this can then be done with Docker, for instance the following\ninvocation will launch ralsh in the context of the container.\ndocker run --rm -t puppet\/libral\n\nThis is intended for exploring the CLI and experimenting with providers.\nUsage\nAfter you build libral, or after you download and unpack the\nprecompiled tarball,\nyou can try things out by running ralsh:\n    # If you downloaded the precompiled tarball\n    alias ralsh=$TARBALL_LOCATION\/ral\/bin\/ralsh\n\n    # Only if you built libral from source\n    export RALSH_DATA_DIR=$LIBRAL_CHECKOUT\/data\n    alias ralsh=$LIBRAL_CHECKOUT\/bin\/ralsh\n\n    # list available types\n    ralsh\n    # list all instances of a type\n    ralsh mount\n    # list a specific instance\n    ralsh service crond\n    # make a change for the better\n    ralsh service crond ensure=stopped\n\n    # Do the same against a remote system to which you have ssh access\n    ralsh -t ahost\n    ralsh -t ahost package sudo\nThe default output from ralsh is meant for human consumption and looks a\nlot like Puppet. It is also possible to have ralsh produce\nJSON output by passing the --json flag.\nMany of the providers that libral knows about are separate\nscripts. ralsh searches them in the following order. In each case, the\nproviders must be executable scripts in a subdirectory providers in the\nmentioned directory ending in .prov:\n\nif the environment variable RALSH_DATA_DIR is set, look in the\ndirectory this variable is set to\nif the --include option to ralsh is given, look in that directory\n(the option can be given multiple times)\ndefault to a directory determined at build time, by default\n\/usr\/share\/libral\/data\n\nRunning inside a container\nThe\nprecompiled tarball\ncontains a statically linked ralsh and all supporting files. After\nunpacking the tarball, you can copy it into a container and run it like\nthis:\n    CONTAINER=<some_container>\n    docker cp $TARBALL_LOCATION\/ral $CONTAINER:\/tmp\n    docker exec $CONTAINER \/bin\/sh -c \/tmp\/ral\/bin\/ralsh\n    docker exec $CONTAINER \/bin\/sh -c '\/tmp\/ral\/bin\/ralsh user root'\nWriting providers\nWhat resources libral can manage is determined by what providers are\navailable. Some providers are built in and implemented in C++, but doing\nthat is of course labor intensive and should only be done for good\nreason. It is much simpler, and recommended, that new providers first be\nimplemented as external providers. External providers are nothing more than\nscripts or other executables that follow one of libral's calling\nconventions. The different calling conventions trade off implementation\ncomplexity for expressive power.\nThe following calling conventions are available. If you are just getting\nstarted with libral, you should write your first providers using the\nsimple or json calling convention:\n\nsimple\njson: input\/output via JSON\njson_batch (planned,maybe): input\/output via JSON, can operate on multiple resources at once\nnative\n\nFor all of these, you will also want to read up on the\nmetadata that each provider needs to produce to describe\nitself.\nTo start a new provider, follow these steps:\n\nDecide on some working directory DIR, run mkdir $DIR\/providers, and\nCreate a file $DIR\/providers\/myprovider.prov and make it executable\nMake sure that running myprovider.prov ral_action=describe returns\nvalid provider metadata, especially a valid type. For\nnow it doesn't matter what the type is, let's call it MYTYPE\nRun ralsh -I $DIR $MYTYPE. This will ask the provider to list all\ninstances of the type using the list action. Get that working\nRun ralsh -I $DIR $MYTYPE NAME. This will ask the provider to find a\nresource with name NAME using the find action. Get that working,\ntoo.\nRun ralsh -I $DIR $MYTYPE NAME ATTR=VALUE.... This will ask the\nprovider to update the resource NAME using the update action.\nYou're done; your provider is ready for a pull request here ;)\n\nTodo list\n\n finish mount provider\n add a shell provider\n event reporting on update\n simple type system and checking for provider attributes\n produce help\/details about providers\n add a json calling convention and use it in a provider\nmore core providers\n\n cron\n file\n group (groupXXX)\n host\n package (besides dnf and yum)\n service (besides systemd, upstart and sysv)\n user (userXXX)\n\n\neven more core providers\n\n interface\n k5login\n mailalias\n selboolean\n selmodule\n sshkey\n ssh-authorized-key\n vlan\n yumrepo\n\n\n add a remote provider (using an HTTP API)\n adapt providers to multiple OS (maybe using mount)\n add support for running providers over ssh (see this PR for details)\n noop mode\n expand the type system to cover as much of Puppet 4 as is reasonable\n\nSome language\nNaming things is hard; here's the terms libral uses:\n\nType: the abstract description of an entity we need to manage; this is\nthe external interface through which entities are managed. I am not\nentirely convinced this belongs in libral at all\nProvider: something that knows how to manage a certain kind of thing\nwith very specific means; for example something that knows how to manage\nusers with the user* commands, or how to manage mounts on Linux\nResource: an instance of something that a provider manages. This is\nclosely tied both to what is being managed and how it is being\nmanaged. The important thing is that resources expose a desired-state\ninterface and therefore abstract away the details of how changes are made\n\nFIXME: we need some conventions around some special resource\nproperties; especially, namevar should always be 'name' and the primary key\nfor all resources from this provider, and 'ensure' should have a special\nmeaning (or should it?)\nOpen questions\n\nDo we need types at all at this level ?\nCan we get away without any provider selection logic ? There are two\nreasons why provider selection is necessary:\n\nadjust to system differences. Could we push those to compile time ?\nmanage different things that are somewhat similar, like system packages\nand gems, or local users and LDAP users ? This would push this\nmodelling decision into a layer above libral.\n\n\nWould it be better to make providers responsible for event generation\nrather than doing that in the framework ?\n\n","389":"DSST: Discriminative Scale Space Tracker\nDSST is part of the Visual Object Tracking Repository,\nwhich aims at providing a central repository for state-of-the-art tracking algorithms that are freely available.\nThe source code for this tracker was submitted for the VOT2014 challenge.\nA minor adaption was made by using MATLAB's imresize() function\ninstead of a custom mex file to increase portability.\nDependencies:\n\nMatlab\nImage Processing Toolbox\nSignal Processing Toolbox\n\nThe following description was copied literally from the original author.\nABSTRACT\nThe Discriminative Scale Space Tracker (DSST), proposed in [2], extends the Minimum Output Sum of Squared\nErrors (MOSSE) tracker [1] with robust scale estimation. The MOSSE tracker works by training a discriminative\ncorrelation filter on a set of observed sample grayscale patches. This correlation filter is then applied to estimate the\ntarget translation in the next frame. The DSST additionally learns a one-dimensional discriminative scale filter, that\nis used to estimate the target size. The scale filter is trained by extracting several sample patches at different scales\naround the current target position in the image. Each sample is represented by a fixed-length feature vector based on\nHOG. These samples are used to learn a multi-channel one-dimensional discriminative filter for scale estimation. This\nscale filter is generic and can be combined with any tracker that is limited to only estimating the target translation.\nGiven a new image, the DSST first applies a translation filter to obtain the most probable target location. The scale\nfilter is then applied at this location to estimate the target size. The tracking model is then updated with the new\ninformation information of the target and background appearance. For the translation filter, we combine the intensity\nfeatures employed in the MOSSE tracker with a pixel-dense representation of HOG-features.\n[1] D. S. Bolme, J. R. Beveridge, B. A. Draper, and Y.

In this world, the days of developers having to raise millions of dollars to build a secure chat, secure email, secure file-sharing, or a secure anything have come to an end.  Now developers can instead focus on building features that give them a competitive market advantage while end-users can enjoy the privacy and security they increasingly demand.\nVirgil Security offers this security via a stack of security libraries (ECIES with Crypto Agility wrapped in Virgil Cryptogram) and all the necessary infrastructure to enable seamless, end-to-end encryption for any application, platform or device. End-to-end encryption can be used for a variety of important reasons: compliance with regulations like HIPAA and GDPR, the transfer and storage of PII, general user privacy as a feature, breach risk mitigation and more.\nVirgil Crypto also has all required cryptographic functions and primitives to perform an implementation of Pythia technology.\nSee below for currently available languages and platforms. Get in touch with us to get beta access to our Key infrastructure.\nLibrary Features\nSupported crypto operations\n\nGenerate keys;\nEncrypt data;\nDecrypt data;\nSign data;\nVerify data;\nPythia protocol.\n\nSupported platforms\nCrypto Library is suitable for the following platforms:\n\nDesktop (Windows, Linux, MacOS);\nMobile (iOS, Android, watchOS, tvOS);\nWeb (WebAssembly, AsmJS)\n\nSupported languages\nCrypto Library is written in C++ [CDN] and supports bindings for the following programming languages:\n\nGo [CDN]\nPHP [CDN]\nPython [CDN]\nRuby [CDN]\nJava [CDN]\nC# [CDN]\nAsmJS [CDN]\nNodeJS [CDN]\nWebAssembly [CDN]\n\nSwift\/Objective_C language can use the Virgil Crypto Library directly, without any bind.\nAvailable Wrappers\nVirgil also has special wrappers for simplifying Crypto Library implementation in your digital solutions.

The possibilities are inifinite\nsince the data is backed up in a WebSQL DataStore, so querying, reporting, etc, would\nbe super quick.\nIf you want to place that in an extension, I have created a bridge, so you can use\nthis in a content script context and extension context safely.

I love this for full projects, but for quick experiments\/demos, it's pretty slow.\nSimilarly create-react-app is great but the setup time in generating a new project can be relatively slow, especially on slow networks when you have to install all the dependencies!\n\nThe idea behind demopack is that it's a pre-packaged Webpack. It includes and configures everything you need, so all you have to do is install demopack once, and then when you run it there's no more setup.\nDemopack is not designed for fully featured projects, but for small demos or one off projects where you need no extra configuration. For \"proper\" projects I recommend either Webpack from scratch or a tool like create-react-app.\nInstallation\nPlease note that demopack is very new and I'm sure it might not work right for all people on all machines. Please open an issue if you have any problems or suggestions!\nYou should install demopack globally so you can easily run it in a directory.\nUnfortunately demopack is taken on npm, so you need to install the scoped version:\nnpm install --global @jackfranklin\/demopack\nyarn global add @jackfranklin\/demopack\n\nYou'll need to be running Node 8 or higher.\nUsage\nGiven a folder with the following file in it:\n\/\/ index.js\nconsole.log('Hello World!');\nRunning demopack in that directory will:\n\nFire up a Webpack server on port 8080 (or another free port).\nGenerate an index.html file that loads your JavaScript.\nParses any JavaScript (including JSX support) and SCSS for you.\n\nWhat Demopack supports\nDemopack has the following Webpack loaders configured out of the box:\n\nbabel-loader which parses .js and .jsx files. It runs using babel-preset-env, babel-preset-react and babel-preset-stage-0. This should mean any fancy JS you want to write should be supported :)\nsass-loader, css-loader and style-loader to load your CSS and SASS (but regular CSS works just fine). If you pass --css-modules CSS Modules will be supported.\nfile-loader to load gif, png, jpg and svg files.\n\nDemopack will run a small local server and will refresh automatically when you change files. Any errors are shown in the terminal and in the page.\nIf there's anything you think should be supported out of the box, feel free to open an issue and we can discuss it.\nProduction build\nThe primary goal of demopack is to be used for development, but you can generate a production build if you like with the --build flag.\nThis will run all the same plugins, with some extras (CSS is pulled into a separate file, JS & CSS is minified).\nThe build will output into .\/demopack-built and will contain an index.html file alongside any assets.\nConfiguration\nThe goal of demopack is to be preconfigured out of the box, but there are some options you can configure. Running demopack --help will show you these:\nOptions:\n  --help          Show help                                            [boolean]\n\n  --version       Show version number                                  [boolean]\n\n  --open-browser  Automatically open the browser when you run demopack. [default: true]\n\n  --css-modules   Enable CSS Modules support.                   [default: false]\n\n  --entry         The JavaScript file that demopack should build from. [default: \"index.js\"]\n\n  --build         Output static files into a directory. JS and CSS will be minified [default: false]\n\nChangelog\n0.2.0\n\nInitial release :)\n\nPrior art \/ credit\n\nThanks to Eduard and his work on create-elm-app which I took a bunch of Webpack code from to make the Demopack terminal output super tidy.\nThanks also to everyone behind create-react-app which was the inspiration behind Demopack initially.\n\n","408":"\ud83d\udea8 NO LONGER ACTIVE \ud83d\udea8\nTrolly\nA Python wrapper around the Trello API. Provides a group of Python classes to represent Trello Objects. None of the\nclasses cache values as they are designed to be inherited and extended to suit the needs of each user. Each class\nincludes a basic set of methods based on general use cases. This library was based on work done by\nsarumont. Very little was kept from this code, but still props on the initial\nwork.\nChanges\n0.2\nTrolly has recently been updated to start the deprecation of non-pythonic conventions and improve PEP8 compliance.\nAll the old pascal cased methods are now deprecated, they have been left in and point to the new method names. There\nare no breaking changes in this release but it is recommended you change your code to use the pythonic naming conventions.\nGetting Started\nDependencies\nThis library requires python 2.5+ or 3+.\nBefore getting stated with this library you will need a few extra things:\n\nhttplib2\nAn API key for your Trello user\nUser authorisation token ( see below for how to obtain )\n\nInstallation\nTo install for python 2 or 3 you can either download the source and run:\nsudo python setup.py install\n\nAlternatively you can use:\nsudo pip install Trolly\n\nAuthorisation\nUser Authorisation Token\nA user authorisation token isn't too hard to get hold of. There are instruction on how to get one on the\nTrello Documentation. For those too\nlazy there is a python class in the library called Authorise(). To use this class simply navigate to authorise.py in a\nterminal and type:\npython authorise.py -a API_KEY APPLICATION_NAME WHEN_TO_EXPIRE\n\nThe API key and application names are required but the \"WHEN_TO_EXPIRE\" will default to 1day if not specified. Running\nthis file will return a URL. Copy and paste it into your browser and away you go. You might want to store this somewhere\nfor future use, especially if you have set it to never expire.\nOauth\nThis library (currently) has no Oauth support however the code this was based on includes Oauth support. So for\ninspiration on how to extend the Client class to include this check out the link above.\nOverview\nThere are a number of methods for each of the Trello objects. Some accept query parameters, these are for API methods\nthat will accept a wide range of values and return a lot of information. For example\nGET Boards will take a lot of query parameters to\nallow you to whittle down the information to the bar minimum. This is extremely useful for extending the classes without\nmuch extra programming.\nTrello Client\nThis class holds the bulk of all the methods for communicating with the trello API and returning the Trello objects.\nA client instance is required by every Trello object, because of this it makes extending and overiding methods in this\nclass very effective. This is where you would override the creating of an object, e.g. a Card, with your own object.\nExample usage of the client:\nclient = trolly.client.Client(settings.API_KEY, settings.TOKEN)\n\nprint('Member: %s' % client.get_member())\n\nprint('Organisations:')\nfor organisation in client.get_organisations():\n    print(' - %s' % organisation)\n\nprint('Organisations:')\nfor organisation in client.get_organisations():\n    print(' - %s' % organisation)\n\nprint('Boards:')\nfor board in client.get_boards():\n    print(' - %s' % board)\n\nprint('Cards:')\nfor card in client.get_cards():\n    print(' - %s' % card)\n\n# Get all information from a card (works for boards, lists, etc. too):\nprint('Detailed cards:')\nfor card in client.get_cards(actions='all'):\n    print(' - %s: %s' % (card, card.data))\n\nTrello Object\nThis class is inhereted my all Trello object classes ( Board, List, Card, etc ). The class takes only one argument, a\nTrello client instance. It masks calls to the client as belonging to the class ( for the purposes of modularity ).\nThere are also a number of methods for fetching ( Board, List, etc ) JSON from the API. Since the only thing that\ndiffers from class to class is the base URI, this is taken as the only argument.\nThere are a number of methods for creating Trello objects. The createOBJECTNAME methods in this class can be extended\neasily by passing them keyword arguments.\nExtending Trello Classes\nExtending these classes is the premise on which they were built. Below outlines an example of how this can be acheived.\nIf for example we wanted to pass extra variables to our a Trello Card object then we can do the below:\nclass MyList( List ):\n\n    def __init__( self, trello_client, list_id, name = '' ):\n        super( MyList, self ).__init__( trello_client, list_id, name )\n\n    def getCards( self ):\n        cards = self.getCardsJson( self.base_uri )\n        return self.createCard( card_json = cards[0], test = 'this is a test argument' )\n\nThis MyList class overrides the getCards method to add the extra variable we need. This would need to be done to any\nTrello object that will return a custom card.\nWe declare and pass the extra ('test') variable as a keyword argument here. We then need to extend the card class to\nallow for the extra variables:\nclass MyCard( Card ):\n\n    def __init__( self, trello_client, card_id, test, name = '' ):\n        super( MyCard, self ).__init__( trello_client, card_id, name )\n        self.test_arg = test\n\nFinally, we extend and override the Client. Overriding the client means that any object that calls createCard will\ncreate one of our new client classes.\nclass MyClient( Client ):\n\n    def __init__( self, api_key, user_auth_token ):\n        super( MyClient, self ).__init__( api_key, user_auth_token )\n\n    def createCard( self, card_json, **kwargs ):\n\n        return MyCard( \n                trello_client = self,\n                card_id = card_json['id'],\n                name = card_json['name'],\n                test = kwargs['test']\n            )\n\nThe above client will fail though if you fail to pass a \"test\" keyword argument. To get around this you could use:\nkwargs.get('test',\"default value\")\n\nThis will help avoid a value not being passed. You could also, instead of extending the object creation, add\na method to cache the details you want using the objects getObjectInformation method.\nHope this helps and happy Trelloing!\nRunning Test\nIn order to run the tests you will need:\n\nAPI Key\nUser authorisation token\nAn organisation ID\nA board ID\nA list ID\nA card ID\nA checklist ID\nA member ID\n\nIt's quite a lot of information to get hold of (sorry). If you don't need everything you can just comment out\nthe tests you don't need.\nTo run the tests navigate to the Trolly in a terminal and run:\nPYTHONPATH=. python test\/tests.py\n\nLicence\nThis code is licenced under the MIT Licence\nContributors\n\nRick van Hatten\n\n","409":"\n\n\n\nStoring settings in the database\nNot all settings belong in settings.py, as it has some particular\nlimitations:\n\n\nSettings are project-wide. This not only requires apps to clutter up\nsettings.py, but also increases the chances of naming conflicts.\nSettings are constant throughout an instance of Django. They cannot be\nchanged without restarting the application.\nSettings require a programmer in order to be changed. This is true even\nif the setting has no functional impact on anything else.\n\n\nMany applications find need to overcome these limitations, and dbsettings\nprovides a convenient way to do so.\nThe main goal in using this application is to define a set of placeholders that\nwill be used to represent the settings that are stored in the database. Then,\nthe settings may be edited at run-time using the provided editor, and all Python\ncode in your application that uses the setting will receive the updated value.\n\nRequirements\n\n\nDbsettings\nPython\nDjango\n\n\n\n==0.10\n3.4 - 3.5\n1.7 - 1.10\n\n3.2 - 3.3\n1.7 - 1.8\n\n2.7\n1.7 - 1.10\n\n==0.9\n3.4 - 3.5\n1.7 - 1.9\n\n3.2 - 3.3\n1.7 - 1.8\n\n2.7\n1.7 - 1.9\n\n==0.8\n3.2\n1.5 - 1.8\n\n2.7\n1.4 - 1.8\n\n2.6\n1.4 - 1.6\n\n==0.7\n3.2\n1.5 - 1.7\n\n2.7\n1.3 - 1.7\n\n2.6\n1.3 - 1.6\n\n==0.6\n3.2\n1.5\n\n2.6 - 2.7\n1.3 - 1.5\n\n<=0.5\n2.6 - 2.7\n1.2* - 1.4\n\n\n\n* Possibly version below 1.2 will work too, but not tested.\n\nInstallation\nTo install the dbsettings package, simply place it anywhere on your\nPYTHONPATH.\n\nProject settings\nIn order to setup database storage, and to let Django know about your use of\ndbsettings, simply add it to your INSTALLED_APPS setting, like so:\nINSTALLED_APPS = (\n    ...\n    'dbsettings',\n    ...\n)\n\nIf your Django project utilizes sites framework, all setting would be related\nto some site. If sites are not present, settings won't be connected to any site\n(and sites framework is no longer required since 0.8.1).\nYou can force to do (not) use sites via DBSETTINGS_USE_SITES = True \/ False\nconfiguration variable (put it in project's settings.py).\nBy default, values stored in database are limited to 255 characters per setting.\nYou can change this limit with DBSETTINGS_VALUE_LENGTH configuration variable.\nIf you change this value after migrations were run, you need to manually alter\nthe dbsettings_setting table schema.\n\nURL Configuration\nIn order to edit your settings at run-time, you'll need to configure a URL to\naccess the provided editors. You'll just need to add a single line, defining\nthe base URL for the editors, as dbsettings has its own URLconf to handle\nthe rest. You may choose any location you like:\nurlpatterns = patterns('',\n    ...\n    (r'^settings\/', include('dbsettings.urls')),\n    ...\n)\n\n\nA note about caching\nThis framework utilizes Django's built-in cache framework, which is used to\nminimize how often the database needs to be accessed. During development,\nDjango's built-in server runs in a single process, so all cache backends will\nwork just fine.\nMost productions environments, including mod_python, FastCGI or WSGI, run multiple\nprocesses, which some backends don't fully support. When using the simple\nor locmem backends, updates to your settings won't be reflected immediately\nin all workers, causing your application to ignore the new changes.\nNo other backends exhibit this behavior, but since simple is the default,\nmake sure to specify a proper backend when moving to a production environment.\nAlternatively you can disable caching of settings by setting\nDBSETTINGS_USE_CACHE = False in settings.py. Beware though: every\naccess of any setting will result in database hit.\n\nUsage\nThese database-backed settings can be applied to any model in any app, or even\nin the app itself. All the tools necessary to do so are available within the\ndbsettings module. A single import provides everything you'll need:\nimport dbsettings\n\n\nDefining a group of settings\nSettings are be defined in groups that allow them to be referenced together\nunder a single attribute. Defining a group uses a declarative syntax similar\nto that of models, by declaring a new subclass of the Group class and\npopulating it with values.\nclass ImageLimits(dbsettings.Group):\n    maximum_width = dbsettings.PositiveIntegerValue()\n    maximum_height = dbsettings.PositiveIntegerValue()\n\nYou may name your groups anything you like, and they may be defined in any\nmodule. This allows them to be imported from common applications if applicable.\n\nDefining individual settings\nWithin your groups, you may define any number of individual settings by simply\nassigning the value types to appropriate names. The names you assign them to\nwill be the attribute names you'll use to reference the setting later, so be\nsure to choose names accordingly.\nFor the editor, the default description of each setting will be retrieved from\nthe attribute name, similar to how the verbose_name of model fields is\nretrieved. Also like model fields, however, an optional argument may be provided\nto define a more fitting description. It's recommended to leave the first letter\nlower-case, as it will be capitalized as necessary, automatically.\nclass EmailOptions(dbsettings.Group):\n    enabled = dbsettings.BooleanValue('whether to send emails or not')\n    sender = dbsettings.StringValue('address to send emails from')\n    subject = dbsettings.StringValue(default='SiteMail')\n\nFor more descriptive explanation, the help_text argument can be used. It\nwill be shown in the editor.\nThe default argument is very useful - it specify an initial value of the\nsetting.\nIn addition, settings may be supplied with a list of available options, through\nthe use of of the choices argument. This works exactly like the choices\nargument for model fields, and that of the newforms ChoiceField.\nThe widget used for a value can be overriden using the widget keyword. For example:\npayment_instructions = dbsettings.StringValue(\n    help_text=\"Printed on every invoice.\",\n    default=\"Payment to Example XYZ\\nBank name here\\nAccount: 0123456\\nSort: 01-02-03\",\n    widget=forms.Textarea\n)\n\nA full list of value types is available later in this document, but the process\nand arguments are the same for each.\n\nAssigning settings\nOnce your settings are defined and grouped properly, they must be assigned to a\nlocation where they will be referenced later. This is as simple as instantiating\nthe settings group in the appropriate location. This may be at the module level\nor within any standard Django model.\nGroup instance may receive one optional argument: verbose name of the group.\nThis name will be displayed in the editor.\nemail = EmailOptions()\n\nclass Image(models.Model):\n    image = models.ImageField(upload_to='\/upload\/path')\n    caption = models.TextField()\n\n    limits = ImageLimits('Dimension settings')\n\nMultiple groups may be assigned to the same module or model, and they can even\nbe combined into a single group by using standard addition syntax:\noptions = EmailOptions() + ImageLimits()\n\nTo separate and tag settings nicely in the editor, use verbose names:\noptions = EmailOptions('Email') + ImageLimits('Dimesions')\n\n\nDatabase setup\nA single model is provided for database storage, and this model must be\ninstalled in your database before you can use the included editors or the\npermissions that will be automatically created. This is a simple matter of\nrunning manage.py syncdb or manage.py migrate now that your settings\nare configured.\nThis step need only be repeate when settings are added to a new application,\nas it will create the appropriate permissions. Once those are in place, new\nsettings may be added to existing applications with no impact on the database.\n\nUsing your settings\nOnce the above steps are completed, you're ready to make use of database-backed\nsettings.\n\nEditing settings\nWhen first defined, your settings will default to None (or False in\nthe case of BooleanValue), so their values must be set using one of the\nsupplied editors before they can be considered useful (however, if the setting\nhad the default argument passed in the constructor, its value is already\nuseful - equal to the defined default).\nThe editor will be available at the URL configured earlier.\nFor example, if you used the prefix of 'settings\/', the URL \/settings\/\nwill provide an editor of all available settings, while \/settings\/myapp\/\nwould contain a list of just the settings for myapp.\nURL patterns are named: 'site_settings' and 'app_settings', respectively.\nThe editors are restricted to staff members, and the particular settings that\nwill be available to users is based on permissions that are set for them. This\nmeans that superusers will automatically be able to edit all settings, while\nother staff members will need to have permissions set explicitly.\n\nAccessing settings in Python\nOnce settings have been assigned to an appropriate location, they may be\nreferenced as standard Python attributes. The group becomes an attribute of the\nlocation where it was assigned, and the individual values are attributes of the\ngroup.\nIf any settings are referenced without being set to a particular value, they\nwill default to None (or False in the case of BooleanValue, or\nwhatever was passed as default). In the\nfollowing example, assume that EmailOptions were just added to the project\nand the ImageLimits were added earlier and already set via editor.\n>>> from myproject.myapp import models\n\n# EmailOptions are not defined\n>>> models.email.enabled\nFalse\n>>> models.email.sender\n>>> models.email.subject\n'SiteMail'  # Since default was defined\n\n# ImageLimits are defined\n>>> models.Image.limits.maximum_width\n1024\n>>> models.Image.limits.maximum_height\n768\n\nThese settings are accessible from any Python code, making them especially\nuseful in model methods and views. Each time the attribute is accessed, it will\nretrieve the current value, so your code doesn't need to worry about what\nhappens behind the scenes.\ndef is_valid(self):\n    if self.width > Image.limits.maximum_width:\n        return False\n    if self.height > Image.limits.maximum_height:\n        return False\nreturn True\n\nAs mentioned, views can make use of these settings as well.\nfrom myproject.myapp.models import email\n\ndef submit(request):\n\n    ...\n    # Deal with a form submission\n    ...\n\n    if email.enabled:\n        from django.core.mail import send_mail\n    send_mail(email.subject, 'message', email.sender, [request.user.email])\n\nSettings can be not only read, but also written. The admin editor is more\nuser-friendly, but in case code need to change something:\nfrom myproject.myapp.models import Image\n\ndef low_disk_space():\n    Image.limits.maximum_width = Image.limits.maximum_height = 200\n\nEvery write is immediately commited to the database and proper cache key is deleted.\n\nA note about model instances\nSince settings aren't related to individual model instances, any settings that\nare set on models may only be accessed by the model class itself. Attempting to\naccess settings on an instance will raise an AttributeError.\n\nValue types\nThere are several various value types available for database-backed settings.\nSelect the one most appropriate for each individual setting, but all types use\nthe same set of arguments.\n\nBooleanValue\nPresents a checkbox in the editor, and returns True or False in Python.\n\nDurationValue\nPresents a set of inputs suitable for specifying a length of time. This is\nrepresented in Python as a timedelta object.\n\nFloatValue\nPresents a standard input field, which becomes a float in Python.\n\nIntegerValue\nPresents a standard input field, which becomes an int in Python.\n\nPercentValue\nSimilar to IntegerValue, but with a limit requiring that the value be\nbetween 0 and 100. In addition, when accessed in Python, the value will be\ndivided by 100, so that it is immediately suitable for calculations.\nFor instance, if a myapp.taxes.sales_tax was set to 5 in the editor,\nthe following calculation would be valid:\n>>> 5.00 * myapp.taxes.sales_tax\n0.25\n\n\nPositiveIntegerValue\nSimilar to IntegerValue, but limited to positive values and 0.\n\nStringValue\nPresents a standard input, accepting any text string up to 255\n(or DBSETTINGS_VALUE_LENGTH) characters. In\nPython, the value is accessed as a standard string.\n\nDateTimeValue\nPresents a standard input field, which becomes a datetime in Python.\nUser input will be parsed according to DATETIME_INPUT_FORMATS setting.\nIn code, one can assign to field string or datetime object:\n# These two statements has the same effect\nmyapp.Feed.next_feed = '2012-06-01 00:00:00'\nmyapp.Feed.next_feed = datetime.datetime(2012, 6, 1, 0, 0, 0)\n\n\nDateValue\nPresents a standard input field, which becomes a date in Python.\nUser input will be parsed according to DATE_INPUT_FORMATS setting.\nSee DateTimeValue for the remark about assigning.\n\nTimeValue\nPresents a standard input field, which becomes a time in Python.\nUser input will be parsed according to TIME_INPUT_FORMATS setting.\nSee DateTimeValue for the remark about assigning.\n\nImageValue\n(requires PIL or Pillow imaging library to work)\nAllows to upload image and view its preview.\nImageValue has optional upload_to keyword, which specify path\n(relative to MEDIA_ROOT), where uploaded images will be stored.\nIf keyword is not present, files will be saved directly under\nMEDIA_ROOT.\n\nPasswordValue\nPresents a standard password input. Retain old setting value if not changed.\n\nSetting defaults for a distributed application\nDistributed applications often have need for certain default settings that are\nuseful for the common case, but which may be changed to suit individual\ninstallations. For such cases, a utility is provided to enable applications to\nset any applicable defaults.\nLiving at dbsettings.utils.set_defaults, this utility is designed to be used\nwithin the app's management.py. This way, when the application is installed\nusing syncdb\/migrate, the default settings will also be installed to the database.\nThe function requires a single positional argument, which is the models\nmodule for the application. Any additional arguments must represent the actual\nsettings that will be installed. Each argument is a 3-tuple, of the following\nformat: (class_name, setting_name, value).\nIf the value is intended for a module-level setting, simply set class_name\nto an empty string. The value for setting_name should be the name given to\nthe setting itself, while the name assigned to the group isn't supplied, as it\nisn't used for storing the value.\nFor example, the following code in management.py would set defaults for\nsome of the settings provided earlier in this document:\nfrom django.conf import settings\nfrom dbsettings.utils import set_defaults\nfrom myproject.myapp import models as myapp\n\nset_defaults(myapp,\n    ('', 'enabled', True)\n    ('', 'sender', settings.ADMINS[0][1]) # Email of the first listed admin\n    ('Image', 'maximum_width', 800)\n    ('Image', 'maximum_height', 600)\n)\n\n\n\nChangelog\n\n0.10.0 (25\/09\/2016)\n\nAdded compatibility with Django 1.10\n\n\n0.9.3 (02\/06\/2016)\n\nFixed (hopefully for good) problem with ImageValue in Python 3 (thanks rolexCoder)\n\n\n0.9.2 (01\/05\/2016)\n\nFixed bug when saving non-required settings\nFixed problem with ImageValue in Python 3 (thanks rolexCoder)\n\n\n0.9.1 (10\/01\/2016)\n\nFixed Sites app being optional (thanks rolexCoder)\n\n\n0.9.0 (25\/12\/2015)\n\nAdded compatibility with Django 1.9 (thanks Alonso)\nDropped compatibility with Django 1.4, 1.5, 1.6\n\n\n0.8.2 (17\/09\/2015)\n\nAdded migrations to distro\nAdd configuration option to change max length of setting values from 255 to whatever\nAdd configuration option to disable caching (thanks nwaxiomatic)\nFixed PercentValue rendering (thanks last-partizan)\n\n\n0.8.1 (21\/06\/2015)\n\nMade django.contrib.sites framework dependency optional\nAdded migration for app\n\n\n0.8.0 (16\/04\/2015)\n\nSwitched to using django.utils.six instead of standalone six.\nAdded compatibility with Django 1.8\nDropped compatibility with Django 1.3\n\n\n0.7.4 (24\/03\/2015)\n\nAdded default values for fields.\nFixed Python 3.3 compatibility\nAdded creation of folders with ImageValue\n\n\n0.7.3, 0.7.2\npypi problems\n0.7.1 (11\/03\/2015)\n\nFixed pypi distribution.\n\n\n0.7 (06\/07\/2014)\n\nAdded PasswordValue\nAdded compatibility with Django 1.6 and 1.7.\n\n\n0.6 (16\/09\/2013)\n\nAdded compatibility with Django 1.5 and python3, dropped support for Django 1.2.\nFixed permissions: added permission for editing non-model (module-level) settings\nMake PIL\/Pillow not required in setup.py\n\n\n0.5 (11\/10\/2012)\n\nFixed error occuring when test are run with LANGUAGE_CODE different than 'en'\nAdded verbose_name option for Groups\nCleaned code\n\n\n0.4.1 (02\/10\/2012)\n\nFixed Image import\n\n\n0.4 (30\/09\/2012)\n\nNamed urls\nAdded polish translation\n\n\n0.3 (04\/09\/2012)\nIncluded testrunner in distribution\n0.2 (05\/07\/2012)\n\nFixed errors appearing when module-level and model-level settings have\nsame attribute names\nCorrected the editor templates admin integration\nUpdated README\n\n\n0.1 (29\/06\/2012)\nInitial PyPI release\n\n","410":"django-predicate\ndjango-predicate provides a Q like object to facilitate the question: \"would\nthis model instance be part of a query\" but without running the query or even\nsaving the object.\n\nQuickstart\nInstall django-predicate:\npip install django-predicate\nThen use the P object just as you would Q objects:\nfrom predicate import P\n\np = P(some_field__startswith=\"hello\", age__gt=20)\nYou can then call the eval method with a model instance to check whether it\npasses the conditions:\nmodel_instance = MyModel(some_field=\"hello there\", age=21)\nother_model_instance = MyModel(some_field=\"hello there\", age=10)\np.eval(model_instance)\n>>> True\np.eval(other_model_instance)\n>>> False\nor you can use Python's in operator.\nmodel_instance in p\n>>> True\nEven though a predicate is not a true container class - it can be used as (and\nwas designed as being) a virtual \"set\" of objects that meets some condiiton.\nLike Q objects, P objects can be &'ed  and |'ed together to form more\ncomplex logic groupings.\nIn fact, P objects are actually a subclass of Q objects, so you can use them in\nqueryset filter statements:\nqs = MyModel.objects.filter(p)\nP objects also support QuerySet-like filtering operations that can be\napplied to an arbitrary iterable: P.get(iterable), P.filter(iterable),\nand P.exclude(iterable):\nmodel_instance = MyModel(some_field=\"hello there\", age=21)\nother_model_instance = MyModel(some_field=\"hello there\", age=10)\np.filter([model_instance, other_model_instance]) == [model_instance]\n>>> True\np.get([model_instance, other_model_instance]) == model_instance\n>>> True\np.exclude([model_instance, other_model_instance]) == [other_model_instance]\n>>> True\nIf you have a situation where you want to use querysets and predicates based on\nthe same conditions, it is far better to start with the predicate.

Also, the API\nis quote a bit more convinient for most use cases.\nOverview\ndmc is really just a wrapper around several other python libraries, but does so\nin a way that makes using these libraries safe.\nSome things to keep in mind:\n\nThere is no such thing as a naive time. ALL times involve a timezone, and that timezone is UTC.\nThe only time we deal with non-UTC timezones is when we parse or display a time.\nWe support math with dates, and math with times, but you can't do date math with times.\nFor example: You can't add \"1 day\" to 2014-03-28 02:00:00, because that\ndoesn't actually make sense. Do you mean add 24 hours? Then do that. Did\nyou mean you want 02:00:00 on 3\/29, sure we can do that, but you have to\ndecide.\n\nWe have a few primary objects:\n\nTime - Represents a precise time in UTC.\nTimeInterval - Represents a change in time, like 10 minutes, or 4000 hours.\nTimeSpan - a range of Times of some TimeInterval length\nTimeIterator - generates time instances based on a TimeSpan and a TimeInterval\nDate - Represents a calendar date. Only the modern Gregorian calendar is supported.\nDateInterval - Represents a change in calendar date, like '2 days', 'next month', or 'next monday'\nDateSpan - a range of dates of some DateInterval.\nDateIterator - genreates dates based on DateSpan and an DateInterval\n\nUsage\n>> start_t = dmc.Time.now()\n>> print start_t\n\"2014-03-29T20:16:58.265249Z\"\n\n>> print start.to_str(tz='Americas\/Los_Angeles')\n\"2014-03-29T12:16:58.265249-7:00\"\n\n>> print start.to_str(local=True)\n\"2014-03-29T12:16:58.265249-7:00\"\n\n>> start.to_str(\"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM\", tz='Americas\/Los_Angeles')\n\"2014-03-29 12:16\"\n\n>> print start_t.to_timestamp()\n1396120755.748726\n\n>> print start_t.to_human()\n\"10 minutes ago\"\n\n>> start_t = dmc.Time.from_timestamp(1396120755.748726)\n\n>> print start_t.to_datetime()\ndatetime.datetime(2014, 3, 29, 12, 16, 58, 0, tzinfo=<UTC>)\n\n>> d = dmc.Date(2014, 3, 28)\n>> print d\n\"2014-03-28\"\n\n>> dmc.Date.from_str(\"3\/28\/2014\")\ndmc.Date(2014, 28, 3)\n\n>> start_t, _ = dmc.TimeSpan.from_date(d)\n>> print start_t\n\"2014-03-28T00:00:00Z\"\n\n# 3 weeks from now\n>> d += dmc.DateInterval(weeks=3)\n\n# Next Sunday\n>> d += dmc.DateInterval(weekday=0)\n\n>> start_t, end_t = dmc.TimeSpan.from_date(d)\n\n>> t = dmc.Time.now()\n>> t += dmc.TimeInterval(minutes=30)\n\n>> today_span = dmc.Date.today().to_timespan()\n>> for t in dmc.TimeIterator(today_span, dmc.TimeInterval(hours=1)):\n>>    print t\n\"2014-03-28T00:00:00Z\"\n\"2014-03-28T01:00:00Z\"\n\"2014-03-28T02:00:00Z\"\n....\n\nTesting\nWhen you're working with date and time sensitive code, it's often very helpful\nto be able to mock out the current time or date. dmc makes this easy:\n>> dmc.set_mock_time(dmc.Time().now() - dmc.TimeInterval(hours=1))\n>> dmc.clear_mock_time()\n\nOr, with a friendly context manager:\n>> with dmc.MockTime(...):\n.... pass\n\nWhat's wrong with datetime\nThis fun old wiki page is enlightening: https:\/\/wiki.python.org\/moin\/WorkingWithTime\nDatetime was supposed to be the solution.

You api key can be\nfound in the developer portal.\nFILEPICKER_API_KEY = <your api key>\n\n\n\nConfigure your media root.\nCWD = os.getcwd()\nMEDIA_ROOT = os.path.join(CWD, 'media')\n\n\n\nAdd a filepicker field to your model and set the upload_to value.\n# *Please note, that FPFileField handle only one file*\n# In demo you can see how to handle multiple files upload.\nfpfile = django_filepicker.models.FPFileField(upload_to='uploads')\n\n\n\nModify your view to accept the uploaded files along with the post data.\nform = models.TestModelForm(request.POST, request.FILES)\nif form.is_valid():\n    #Save will read the data and upload it to the location\n    # defined in TestModel\n    form.save()\n\n\n\nAdd the form.media variable above your other JavaScript calls.\n<head>\n    <title>Form Template Example<\/title>\n    <!--  Normally this would go into a block defined in base.html that\n          occurs before other JavaScript calls. -->\n    {{ form.media }}\n<\/head>\n\n<body>\n    <form method=\"POST\" action=\"\/\" enctype=\"multipart\/form-data\">\n        {{ form.as_p }}\n        <input type=\"submit\" \/>\n    <\/form>\n<\/body>\n\n\n\n##Demo\nTo see how all the pieces come together, see the example code in demo\/, which you can run with the standard\npython manage.py runserver command\n###models.py\nimport django_filepicker\nclass TestModel(models.Model):\n#FPFileField is a field that will render as a filepicker dragdrop widget, but\n#When accessed will provide a File-like interface (so you can do fpfile.read(), for instance)\nfpfile = django_filepicker.models.FPFileField(upload_to='uploads')\n###views.py\n#building the form - automagically turns the uploaded fpurl into a File object\nform = models.TestModelForm(request.POST, request.FILES)\nif form.is_valid():\n#Save will read the data and upload it to the location defined in TestModel\nform.save()\nBe sure to also provide your Filepicker.io api key, either as a parameter to the FPFileField or in settings.py as FILEPICKER_API_KEY\n##Components\n###Models\nThe filepicker django library defines the FPFileField model field so you can get all the benefits of using Filepicker.io as a drop-in replacement for the standard django FileField. No need to change any of your view logic.\n###Forms\nSimilarly with the FPFileField for models, the filepicker django library defines a FPFileField for forms as well, that likewise serves as a drop-in replacement for the standard django FileField. There is also the FPUrlField if you want to store the Filepicker.io URL instead\n###Middleware\nAlso included is a middleware library that will take any Filepicker.io urls passed to the server, download the contents, and place the result in request.FILES. This way, you can keep your backend code for handling file uploads the same as before while adding all the front-end magic that Filepicker.io provides\nIf you have any questions, don't hesitate to reach out at contact@filepicker.io.

Untick to treat all videos as having 30 fps, but this may make encoding inefficient and increase bitrate more than necessary.\nSpeedy Math tries to speed up OpenCL floating point math by making it less accurate, but should be good enough.\nSwitch byte order : for the rare case when input bitmap is RGB(A) instead of BGR(A).\nHeader insertion : adds SPS\/PPS to every frame, may make cutting\/splitting video easier. More of a 'debug' feature.\n\nQuickset buttons for speed vs quality:\n\nSpeed : encodes 1080p at 60+ fps (theoretical max 80+)\nBalanced : encodes 1080p at 40+ fps\nQuality : encodes 1080p at 30+ fps (can probably do 720p@60)\n\nWith newer AMD cards (hawaii+), seem to support B-frames, though VCE may not actually generate B-frames with OpenVideo, and AVI kinda sucks with these (see).

A need that from our own experience could not be totally fulfilled by any of the existing solutions. Things like installing libraries, updating the software or installing the IDE can be quite a painful process.\nIn addition to the above, the limited features provided (e.g. insufficient highlighting, indentation and autocompletion) got us starting building codebender, a completely web-based IDE, that requires no installation and offers a great code editor. It also stores your sketches on the cloud.\nThat way, you can still access your sketches safely even if your laptop is stolen or your hard drive fails! codebender also takes care of compilation, giving you extremely descriptive warnings on terrible code. On top of that, when you are done, you can upload your code to your Arduino straight from the browser without installing anything.\nCurrently codebender.cc is running its beta and we are trying to fix issues that may (will) come up so that we can launch and offer our services to everyone!\nIf you like what we do you can also support our campaign on indiegogo to also get early access to codebender!\nHow do these \"arduino-files\" come into the picture?\ncodebender.cc runs on PHP Fog, a PaaS that helps us run our PHP projects in a fast and scallable manner. However, we need to run our compiler on some VPS.\nThe compiler repository includes all the necessary files needed to run the compiler as a service. This includes the arduino examples, libraries, etc. This is a repository that includes all of these necessary files, which the compiler repository then includes as a submodule.\n","438":"adventures-reactive-web-dev\nAdventures in Reactive Web Development.\nExploring various libraries, frameworks, and techniques for reactive web development, including:\n\nAngular 2\nCycle.js\nElm\nReact\n\nwith Redux\nwith RxJS\n\n\nYolk\n\nAlso part of the adventure:\n\nsnabbdom\nmost and most-subject\n\nRequirements\nYou need to have Node.js installed to run the examples.\nThere are several ways to install Node.js, including Homebrew and nvm.\nOne-time setup\nYou only need to run this command once:\nnpm i -g bower\n\nThis installs Bower.

You only have to save the file to see your changes. Recompilation and browser page reload happen automatically.\nBranches\nThe master branch contains the most up-to-date code. However, you may be interested in other branches.\nSimply run git checkout <branchname> to check out a branch, replacing <branchname> with one of the following:\n\nng2-webpack : Angular 2 example using RxJS instead of Redux\nng2-systemjs : Angular 2 example using SystemJS instead of Webpack\nreact-router : React example using React-Router\nclient-elm branches : there are 4 branches for the\n4-part article\nabout the Elm example.\n\nFinally, please note that the examples use Webpack. I left the ng2-systemjs branch there for reference, but I had a lot of trouble using SystemJS and I did not like having to add a bunch of <script> tags. I prefer the Webpack setup, which includes automatic recompilation and page refresh, so once I had that set up and working, I went with it for the rest of the examples.\n","439":"Radial Bubble Tree\n![bubble tree screenshot](http:\/\/driven-by-data.net\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/06\/Bildschirmfoto-2011-07-02-um-23.02.50.png bubbletree screenshot right)\nBubbleTree is a library for interactive visualization of hierarchical data.

You can also use it to merge traditional pre-ES6 React mixin objects into your ES6 React classes.\nInspired by this gist by Sebastian Markb\u00e5ge the strategy is transient class hierarchies \u2013 instead of locking classes into permanent is a roles, class realtionships are assembled and re-assembled at will.\nES6 mixins are functions that return classes. The base parameter is used internally to construct the mixin chain. There's no need to extend React.component, you get that for free.\nconst es6Mixin = base => class extends base {\n  componentWillMount() {\n    console.log(\"augmented componentWillMount\");\n  }\n  render() {\n    console.log(\"augmented render\");\n  }\n};\nReact components invoke mixins with a call to super.\nimport mixin from 'es6-react-mixins';\nimport React from 'react';\n\nclass MyComponent extends mixin(es6Mixin) {\n  componentWillMount() {\n    super.componentWillMount();\n  }\n  render() {\n    super.render();\n    return <div>hello\/div>;\n  }\n}\n\nReact.render(<MyComponent>, document.body);\nThe API works with any number of mixins. Obviously order matters with multiple mixins \u2013 each super call works its way up the mixin hierarchy.\nconst mixin1 = base => class extends base {\n  componentWillMount() {\n    super.componentWillMount();\n    console.log(\"mixin1 componentWillMount\");\n  }\n  render() {\n    super.render();\n    console.log(\"mixin1 render\");\n  }\n};\n\nconst mixin2 = base => class extends base {\n  componentWillMount() {\n    super.componentWillMount();\n    console.log(\"mixin2 componentWillMount\");\n  }\n  render() {\n    super.render();\n    console.log(\"mixin2 render\");\n  }\n};\n\nclass MyComponent extends mixin(mixin1, mixin2) {\n  componentWillMount() {\n    super.componentWillMount();\n  }\n  render() {\n    super.render();\n    return <div>hello\/div>;\n  }\n}\nNotice that any mixin can call super, even though there may be no other mixins to hear it. Every mixin descends from a base mixin with no-op implementations of the react lifecycle methods.\nes6-react-mixins also accepts traditional plain object mixins (a la pre-ES6 React), adapting them to ES6 style mixins internally.\nvar reactMixin = {\n  componentWillMount: function () {\n    console.log\n  },\n  render: function () {\n    this.reactMixin_rendered = true;\n  }\n};\n\nclass MyComponent extends mixin(reactMixin) {\n  componentWillMount() {\n    super.componentWillMount();\n  }\n  render() {\n    super.render();\n    return <div>hello\/div>;\n  }\n}\nInstallation\nnpm install es6-react-mixins\n\nThe source is written in es6 but there's an npm prebublish step which transpiles to es5 and dumps into lib directory - which is the default import.\nTesting\nnpm test\n\nContributions\nYes please!\n","448":"Powerhose\nPowerhose turns your CPU-bound tasks into I\/O-bound tasks so your Python applications\nare easier to scale.\n\nPowerhose is an implementation of the\nRequest-Reply Broker\npattern in ZMQ.\nSee http:\/\/powerhose.readthedocs.org for a full documentation.\n","449":"dm_bot\n** This bot has been decomissioned **\nThis bot is more of a learning exercise than anything else, no harm intended.\nIt works by using phantom.js and selenium to grab a screenshot of the whole page and mark some points for reference.

Django-extension comes with tons of useful management commands,\nrun python manage.py help to get an overview.\nThe production setup\nThe production environment can't be set up automatically (at it may require\nsetting up databaes details and other per-server settings manually), but there\nare some helper Makefile tasks to speed it up.\nTo set up the production environment for a DJ Skeletor-powered project, loosely\nfollow this procedure:\n# prepare the virtual environment\nmkvirtualenv --no-site-packages myenv\n\n# get your project\ngit clone <myproject-url>\ncd myproject\n\n# install the requirements\nmake reqs\/prod\n\n# create a project\/settings\/local.py settings file with per-server config\nvim project\/settings\/local.py\n\n# run automatic update (db sync\/migrations, collectstatic)\nmake prod-update\n\n# your production environment is now ready\npython manage.py run_gunicorn\n\nOf course, your mileage may vary.\nThe settings files\nThe settings files base (base settings used in all environments),\nprod (production settings), dev (local development settings) and\ntest (settings used when running automated tests) should contain only the\nsettings used by all developers\/servers.\nPer-server (or per-developer) settings should go into local module\n(ie. project\/settings\/local.py). The usual pattern for this module is to\nfirst import everything from the settings variant that best matches your\nenvironment (prod for servers, dev for local development), and then\noverride\/add settings as needed.\nExample production settings just specifying the production database:\n# file: project\/settings\/local.py\nfrom .prod import *\n\nDATABASES = {\n    'default': { ... }\n}\n\nYou shouldn't need to add local.py to the repository (in fact, git is\nalready set up to ignore it). If some setting needs to be shared by everyone,\nit should probably be added to base, dev or prod.\nThe local settings file isn't required. If it doesn't exist, the production\nsetup will be used by default. This is useful if you don't have per-server\nsettings or they're deployed via Unix environment (as they are on eg. Heroku\nand similar cloud hosting providers).\nEnvironment settings\nIn either production or develoment mode, settings can also be set via\nthe environment variables. The following variables are supported:\n\nDATABASE_URL - Heroku-compatible database URL\nDEBUG - String true enables DEBUG, any other disables\nTEMPLATE_DEBUG - String true enables TEMPLATE_DEBUG, any other disables\nCOMPRESS_ENABLED - String true enables django-compressor, any other\ndisables\nSQL_DEBUG - String true enables SQL statement logging, any other\ndisables (disabled by default, available only if using dev.py)\nCACHE_BACKEND - String value to put into CACHES['default']['BACKEND']\nEMAIL_BACKEND - String value for EMAIL_BACKEND (only if using dev.py)\n\nNote that values from local.py override environment settings! You probably\nwant to use either the local settings file or the environment settings, not\nmix them.\nHeroku support\nThe production setup uses database autodiscovery so if you have a (promoted)\ndatabase in Heroku, it will automatically get picked up.\nFor Heroku, you'll probably want to add the Procfile file with contents\nsimilar to this:\nweb: python manage.py run_gunicorn --workers=4 --bind=0.0.0.0:$PORT\n\nIf your web app supports uploading of media (eg. images, videos or other\nfiles) by users, you'll probably need the django-storages app to\nautomatically host them somewhere else (eg on Amazon S3). When\ndjango-storages is set up, the collecstatic management command (run as\npart of make prod-update) will copy the static assets to the specified\nservice as well.\nAfter pushing the new code to Heroku for update, you should make sure to run\nall the needed management commands to migrate the database, etc:\nheroku run make prod-update\n\nDjango Debug Toolbar\nDjango Debug Toolbar is set up so it's always visible in the dev\nenvironment, no matter what the client IP is, and always hidden in\nthe production environment.\nSentry \/ Raven\nTo use the Sentry client, you'll need a server to point it to. Installing\nSentry server is easy as:\n# mkvirtualenv --no-site-packages sentry-env\n# pip install sentry\n# sentry init\n# sentry start\n\nYou'll want to install Sentry into its own environment as it requires\nDjango 1.2 or 1.3 at the moment.\nIf you don't want to install Sentry yourself, you can use a hosted\nversion at http:\/\/getsentry.com\/.\nWhen you connect to your (or hosted) Sentry server and create a new project\nthere, you'll be given Sentry DSN which you need to put into production\nsettings to activate Sentry exception logging.\nCompressor\nDjango Compressor can minify and compile your CSS and JS assets. DJ Skeletor\ncomes with Compressor support, but to make use of it, you need to use\n{% compress %} tags in your templates.\nBy default Compressor runs in online mode, and files are compressed\nand cached (if needed) when the template that uses them is first served.\nOptionally, it can also use offline mode (COMPRESSOR_OFFLINE) in which\nthe static files are pre-compressed in deployment phase. To activate this,\nyou'll need to activate the COMPRESSOR_OFFLINE setting (it's commented\nout in settings\/prod.py by default) and update Makefile to run the\ncompressor in the deployment phase.\nNote that if you enable offline mode, you will need to run compress after\nevery template or static file change, so it's recommended to only use it\nfor deployed\/production environments.\nTest code coverage\nDJ Skeletor comes with support for nose test runner and code coverage\nreporting through coverage.py.\nTo run a normal test without code coverage report, run make test.\nTo run a test with a coverage report, run make coverage. The report\nis generated in HTML format in the cover\/ subdirectory, and in the\nCobertura format in coverage.xml file (useful for integrating with\nContinuous Integration systems, such as Jenkins). The test run also produces\nnosetests.xml file in the standard JUnit format, also useful for integration\nwith Jenkins or other CI systems.\nDeployments via git\nIf deployments are done via git (and not fabric, see below), it's\nrecommended to create another Makefile target that will do the deploy, for\nexample:\ndeploy:\n  git pull\n  $(MAKE) update\n  # command to restart the service(s) as neccessary\n\nFabric\nA fabfile is provided with common tasks for rsyncing local directory to\nthe server for use while developing the project, and for deploying the\nproject using git clone\/pull.\nUseful commands:\n\nserver - host to connect to (same as -H, but accepts only one argument)\nenv - virtualenv name on the server, as used with virtualenvwrapper\/workon\nproject_path - full path to the project directory on the server\nrsync - use rsync to copy the local folder to the project directory on the server\nsetup - set up the project instance on the server (clones the origin\nrepository, creates a virtual environment, initialises the database and\nruns the tests)\ndeploy - deploy a new version of project on the server using git pull\ncollecstatic, syncdb, migrate, runserver - run manage.py command\nupdate - combines collecstatic, syncdb, migrate\ntest - run manage.py test with the test settings enabled\n\nFor all the commands, run 'fab -l' or look at the source.\nExamples:\nCopy local directory to the server, update database and static files, and\nrun tests (only files changed from last copy are going to be copied):\nfab server:my.server.com env:myenv project_path:\/path\/to\/project rsync update test\n\nDeploy a new instance of a project on a server ('myenv' will be newly created,\ncode will be cloned into \/path\/to\/project):\nfab server:my.server.com env:myenv project_path:\/path\/to\/project \\\n    setup:origin=http:\/\/github.com\/senko\/dj-skeletor\n\nDeploy a new version of the project on the server (a new git tag will be\ncreated for each deployment, so it's easy to roll-back if needed):\nfab server:my.server.com env:myenv project_path:\/path\/to\/project deploy\n\nCustomization\nEveryone has a slightly different workflow, so you'll probably want to\ncustomize the default fabric tasks or combine them. You can either customize\nfabfile.py and commit the changes to your repository, or you can create\nlocal_fabfile.py, which will be loaded if it exists. The latter can be useful\nif you have per-team-member fabric customizations you don't want to commit\nto the repository.\nRenaming the project\nBy default, DJ Skeletor names the project project, so it's generic enough\nto not requiring the change for each project, so the initial setup is\na bit faster (and the manage.py logic is simpler).\nIf you do want to change the project name though, there's couple of things\nyou need to do. For example, if you want to rename the project to foo:\n\nrename the folder: git mv project foo\nupdate Makefile, manage.py and\u02dbfabfile to set PROJECT_NAME to foo\ncommit the changes to your git repository and you're done!\n\n","454":"spec\nWhat is it?\nspec is a Python (2.6+ and 3.3+) testing tool that turns this:\n\ninto this:\n\nSpecifically, spec provides:\n\nColorized, specification style output\nColorized tracebacks and summary\nOptional timing display for slow tests\nTest-running CLI tool which enables useful non-default options and implements\nrelaxed test discovery for less test_annoying.py:TestBoilerplate.test_code\nand more readable.py:Classes.and_methods.\n\nSpec-style output\nspec is a BDD-esque\nnose plugin designed to provide \"specification\"\nstyle test output (similar to Java's\nTestDox or Ruby's\nRSpec). Spec-style output provides a more\nstructured view of what your tests assert, compared to nose\/unittest's\ndefault \"flat\" mode of operation.\nFor example, this nose-style test module:\nclass TestShape(object):\n    def test_has_sides(self):\n        pass\n\n    def test_can_calculate_its_perimeter(self):\n        pass\n\nclass TestSquare(object):\n    def test_is_a_shape(self):\n        pass\n\n    def test_has_four_sides(self):\n        pass\n\n    def test_has_sides_of_equal_length(self):\n        pass\nnormally tests like so, in a single flat list:\nTestShape.test_has_sides ... ok\nTestShape.test_can_calculate_its_perimeter ... ok\nTestSquare.test_has_four_sides ... ok\nTestSquare.test_has_sides_of_equal_length ... ok\nTestSquare.test_is_a_shape ... ok\n\nWith spec enabled (--with-spec), the tests are visually grouped by class,\nand the member names are tweaked to read more like regular English:\nShape\n- has sides\n- can calculate its perimeter\n\nSquare\n- has four sides\n- has sides of equal length\n- is a shape\n\nIn other words:\n\nClass-based tests are arranged with the class name as the subject, and the\nmethods as the specifications;\nAny module-level tests are arranged with the module name as the subject;\nAll objects' docstrings are used as their descriptions, if found. Otherwise:\n\nCamelCaseNames (typically classes) have any leading\/trailing Test\nstripped, as well as any trailing underscore;\nCamelCaseNames also get turned into sentences if necessary, so e.g.\nCamelCaseNames becomes Camel case names;\nunderscored_names have any leading\/trailing test (with its attached\nunderscore) stripped;\nunderscored_names have underscores turned into spaces;\n\n\n\nTest runner\nspec ships with a same-name command-line tool which may be used as a more\nliberal nosetests. In addition to toggling a number of useful default options\n(such as nose's builtin --detailed-errors) spec-the-program will honor\nany and all public objects defined within your project's tests directory,\nmeaning any file, function or class whose name does not begin with an\nunderscore ('_') and which is defined locally.\nFor example, given the following code inside tests\/feature_name.py:\nfrom external_module import a_function, AClass\n\ndef _helper_function(args):\n    return a_function(args)\n\nclass _Parent(object):\n    def this_will_not_get_tested():\n        pass\n\nclass Feature(_Parent):\n    def should_have_some_attribute(self):\n        _helper_function(AClass)\n\n    def does_something_awesome(self):\n        self._helper_method()\n\n    def _helper_method(self):\n        pass\n\ndef something_tested_by_itself_outside_a_class():\n    pass\nonly the following items will be picked up as test cases:\n\nFeature.should_have_some_attribute\nFeature.does_something_awesome\nsomething_tested_by_itself_outside_a_class\n\nThe imported function and class, the underscored functions\/methods, and the\nmethods inherited from a parent class, are all ignored.\nEnhanced output via the Spec class\nAs with some other spec-style tools, spec provides a means for nesting your\ntest \"contexts\" so they display nicely during test runs. Just use the Spec\nclass as your primary superclass and inner classes will get parsed\nautomatically.\nFor example:\nfrom spec import Spec\n\nclass ClassUnderTest(Spec):\n    def it_behaves_like_this(self):\n        # ...\n\n    class init:\n        \"__init__\"\n        def takes_arg1(self):\n            # ...\n\n        def takes_arg2(self):\n            # ...\nThe above results in output like so:\nClass under test\n- it behaves like this\n\n    __init__\n    - takes arg1\n    - takes arg2\n\nThis indentation makes output even easier to follow & helps keep things\norganized.\nAccessing outer classes from inner ones\nFrequently, you may have a useful setup method in your outer class, and wish\nto access objects attached to self from inner classes. As of Spec 0.11.0 this\nis now possible and is quite transparent; failed attribute lookups will check\nan instantiated + setup'd copy of the outer class:\nclass MainClass(Spec):\n    def setup(self):\n        self.x = 'y'\n\n    def outer_test(self):\n        assert self.x == 'y'\n\n    class some_inner_class:\n        def inner_test(self):\n            # Here, because some_inner_class has no real 'x' attribute, we end\n            # up seeing the outer class' value.\n            assert self.x == 'y'\nRight now this support is pretty basic and assumes your setup methods are\nliterally named setup, not setUp or whatnot. This will likely improve in\nthe future.\nUsage tips\nFollowing from spec-the-tool's discovery algorithm, and spec-the-plugin's\nname transformation, we suggest the following for both readable code and\nreadable test output:\n\nStore tests in tests\/, with whatever file-by-file organization you like\nbest;\nWithin files, import the classes under test normally, e.g. from mymodule import MyClass;\nName the test classes identically, but with a trailing underscore to avoid\nname collisions, and inheriting from the Spec class, e.g. class MyClass_(Spec): [...]\nName their methods like English sentences, e.g. def has_attribute_X(self): [...].\nTests not yet filled out should call the skip function, which raises a\n\"skip this test\" exception Nose handles correctly.\n\nFor example:\nfrom spec import Spec, skip\nfrom mypackage import MyClass, MyOtherClass\n\nclass MyClass_(Spec):\n    def has_attribute_A(self):\n        skip()\n\nclass MyOtherClass_(Spec):\n    def also_has_attribute_A(self):\n        skip()\n\n    def has_attribute_B(Spec):\n        skip()\ntests as:\nMyClass\n- has attribute A\n\nMyOtherClass\n- also has attribute A\n- has attribute B\n\nActivation \/ command-line use\nAfter installation via setup.py, pip or what have you, nosetests will\nexpose these new additional options\/flags:\n\n--with-spec: enables the plugin and prints out your tests in specification\nformat. Also automatically sets --verbose (i.e. the spec output is a\nverbose format.)\n--no-spec-color: disables color output. Normally, successes are green,\nfailures\/errors are red, and\nskipped tests are\nyellow.\n--spec-doctests: enables (experimental) support for doctests.\n--with-timing: enables timing display for tests that take >=\nTIMING_THRESHOLD (see below) to run.\n--timing-threshold: configuration of timing threshold (in seconds) for\n--with-timing. Defaults to 0.1.\n\nWhy would I want to use it?\nSpecification-style output can make large test suites easier to read, and like\nany other BDD tool, it's more about framing the way we think about (and view)\nour tests, and less about introducing new technical methods for writing them.\nWhere did it come from?\nspec is heavily based on the spec plugin for Titus Brown's\npinocchio\nset of Nose extensions. Said plugin was originally written by Michal\nKwiatkowski. Both pinocchio and its spec plugin are copyright \u00a9 2007\nin the above two gentlemen's names, respectively.\nThis version of the plugin was created and distributed by Jeff Forcier, \u00a9\n2011. It tweaks the original source to be Python 2.7 compatible, based on\nsimilar\nchanges.\nIt also fixes a handful of bugs such as broken\nSkipTest\ncompatibility under Nose 1.x, and then adds some additional functionality on\ntop (most notably the spec command-line tool.)\nWhat's the license?\nBecause this is heavily derivative of pinocchio, spec is licensed the same\nway -- under the MIT\nlicense.\n","455":"Django-Pluggables\nDjango-Pluggables provides a design pattern for making reusable apps \"pluggable\" so that apps can exist at multiple URL locations and be presented by other apps or models.\n\nOverview\nDjango-Pluggables is a design pattern that endows reusable applications with a few additional features:\n\nApplications can exist at multiple URL locations (e.g. http:\/\/example.com\/foo\/app\/ and http:\/\/example.com\/bar\/app\/).\nApplications can be \"parented\" to other applications or objects which can then deliver specialized context information.\nPosting form data and error handling can happen in locations that make sense to the user, as opposed to the common practice of using templatetags and standalone error or preview pages for form data processing.\nViews and templates remain generic and reusable.\n\n\nInstallation\nDjango-Pluggables can be added to your Django project like any other reusable app. To see the examples in action, fun the following commands:\nFirst off, the native Mac implementation of sed is not as robust as we expect. Therefore install Super Sed  Then run\n$ easy_install Fabric==0.1.1 pip virtualenv\n$ fab bootstrap\n$ .\/examples\/sillywalks\/manage.py runserver\n\nVoila! You now have a fully functional site running at http:\/\/127.0.0.1:8000\/\n\nUsage\nTo utilize Django-Pluggables, you will need to do a little bit of configuration. First you must have a two applications:\n\nA reusable app that will be made Pluggable.\nAn app that will expose an instance of the Pluggable app in its URL hierarchy (this app does not need to be reusable).\n\nInstallation and development of these two apps can begin normally. The individual functions of the apps should be standalone. The Django-Pluggables pattern delivers needed context and parameters to the app that is being made Pluggable when it is called from the URL hierarchy of the other app.\nTo set up the relationship between these two apps, it is necessary to define two items:\n\nThe URLconf that defines the URLs that will invoke the Pluggable app instance.\nThe pluggable definition that will supply the Pluggable app with its required context and parameters.\n\n\nNote\nIn the following examples we will use two imaginary apps: sillywalks and complaints. These would be imported in your modules like so:\nfrom sillywalks.models import Walk\nfrom complaints.models import Complaint\n\nIn the examples we discuss below, the sillywalks app lives at the URL:\nhttp:\/\/example.com\/sillywalks\/\n\nThe sillywalks app utilizes the complaints app to field complaints about various types of walk. To provide an excellent user experience, the complaints forms and functionality should be presented at a URL beneath the sillywalks URL:\nhttp:\/\/example.com\/sillywalks\/<walk_name>\/complaints\/\n\nAlso, the presentation of complaints functionality beneath the sillywalks app should adhere to the sillywalks templates pattern, including various walk-specific information that must be supplied through additional, non- complaints app context.\n\n\nDefining the URLconf\nIn order to make the complaints app pluggable, we first must define a pluggable URLs file for it:\nclass ComplaintsPluggable(PluggableApp):\n    urlpatterns = patterns('',\n        url(r'^$', 'complaints.views.view_complaint', name='complaints_view_complaint'),\n        url(r'^activity_feed\/$', 'complaints.views.submit_complaint', name='complaints_submit_complaint'),\n\n...\n\n\nNote\nOnly one pluggable URLs file is required for an app that you wish to make pluggable. This URLconf may be subclassed for additional flexibility when using the pluggable app in conjunction with other apps, but it is likely that one definition of pluggable URLs will be sufficient for most use cases.\n\n\nDefining the Pluggable Config and Context\nOnce the complaints app has been set up with the pluggable URLs, it is necessary to define the context that will be delivered to the complaints app and add these URLs to the URLconf for the sillywalks app:\nfrom complaints.urls import ComplaintsPluggable\n\nclass SillyWalkComplaints(ComplaintsPluggable):\n    def pluggable_view_context(self, request, complaint_id):\n        return dict(complaint_id=complaint_id)\n\n    def pluggable_template_context(self, request, slug):\n        return dict(silly_walk=SillyWalk.objects.get(slug=slug))\n\n    def pluggable_config(self):\n        return dict(base_template='sillywalks\/base.html')\n\nurlpatterns = SillyWalkComplaints('sillywalk')\n\n\nMore\nThe primary repository for Django-Pluggables is located at:\nhttp:\/\/github.com\/nowells\/django-pluggables\/\nDjango-Pluggables was created by Nowell Strite.\n","456":"Sublime IPython Notebook\nThis is a Sublime Text 3 plugin that emulates IPython notebook interface inside Sublime.\nNOTE: this plugin does not work with the latest versions of Ipython Notebook!

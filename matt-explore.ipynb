information user interface goal project project done hackuarium association diy biology hackingspace open laboratory located ecublens switzerland feel free contact u would like additional information would like buy fully built tested spectrophotometer recently opensource openhardware community involved creation open scientific tool context spectrophotometer project emerged however none sufficiently evolved casually used laboratory reason started project goal create simple spectrophotometer measure absorbance sample 3 different light color red green blue selfcontained battery powered display result lcd screen addition tool reliable precise cheap initial idea could teach spectrophotometry without buy expensive instrument since find experiment require specific light wavelength includes optical density bacteria culture determination pigment concentration solution determination kinetic reaction many others device rather cheap buy component aliexpress one either 3d print laser cut case mdf acrylic glass constructing 10 price per spectrophotometer around 30 however want final product aluminium case pcbs already assembled cost would rather 90 order 20 science trying explain done detail maybe first question answer science tool thinking design spectro found light sensor convert light energy frequency linear range nearly 106 mean luminosity range measure precisely really big precision component therefore really promising show could something give good result indeed final product give really accurate result field like chemistry biology see lab notebook result patent blue v begin simple experiment allows measure absorbance solution containing different known concentration patent blue v e131 blue pigment used various blue candy result rather good knowing solution simply prepared adding various volume 0 2 ml concentrated pigmented solution 1ml seringe 100ml water accurate method escherichia coli another feature simplespectrophotometer work rechargeable battery autonomy 48 hour consequently measure kinetic placing device directly inside incubator feasible regular commercial spectrophotometer optical density od 600nm often used biology determine biomass increase versus time experiment placed escherichia coli cell growing medium directly spectrophotometer cuvette placed spectrophotometer shaker incubator program measure absorbance every x second case measured absorbance every 30 minute 40 measure following curve obtained experiment clearly show log phase stationary phase growth faster expected acquisition every 15 minute would better choice using simple spectrophotometer teach science use spectrophotometer rather simple put blank press button wait 10 put sample result displayed screen addition could open student could see inside could really understand tool work avoiding black box effect also since inexpensive ten classroom would possible would allow student one instrument per pair using spectrophotometer reason also consider instrument pedagogical tool allowed u use teach basic scientific concept group child teenager school mondomo colombia make electronic design compatible arduino platform use atmega32u4 microcontroller directly connected peripheral need spectrophotometer prefer design full pcb rather make shield existing arduino board indeed extra work add microcontroller rather limited make sense point view create shield also resulting board smaller reliable component use one mainstream found ebay aliexpress special component light frequency converter tsl235r buy mouser website detail construction process follow one

information user interface goal project project done hackuarium association diy biology hackingspace open laboratory located ecublens switzerland feel free contact u would like additional information would like buy fully built tested spectrophotometer recently opensource openhardware community involved creation open scientific tool context spectrophotometer project emerged however none sufficiently evolved casually used laboratory reason started project goal create simple spectrophotometer measure absorbance sample 3 different light color red green blue selfcontained battery powered display result lcd screen addition tool reliable precise cheap initial idea could teach spectrophotometry without buy expensive instrument since find experiment require specific light wavelength includes optical density bacteria culture determination pigment concentration solution determination kinetic reaction many others device rather cheap buy component aliexpress one either 3d print laser cut case mdf acrylic glass constructing 10 price per spectrophotometer around 30 however want final product aluminium case pcbs already assembled cost would rather 90 order 20 science trying explain done detail maybe first question answer science tool thinking design spectro found light sensor convert light energy frequency linear range nearly 106 mean luminosity range measure precisely really big precision component therefore really promising show could something give good result indeed final product give really accurate result field like chemistry biology see lab notebook result patent blue v begin simple experiment allows measure absorbance solution containing different known concentration patent blue v e131 blue pigment used various blue candy result rather good knowing solution simply prepared adding various volume 0 2 ml concentrated pigmented solution 1ml seringe 100ml water accurate method escherichia coli another feature simplespectrophotometer work rechargeable battery autonomy 48 hour consequently measure kinetic placing device directly inside incubator feasible regular commercial spectrophotometer optical density od 600nm often used biology determine biomass increase versus time experiment placed escherichia coli cell growing medium directly spectrophotometer cuvette placed spectrophotometer shaker incubator program measure absorbance every x second case measured absorbance every 30 minute 40 measure following curve obtained experiment clearly show log phase stationary phase growth faster expected acquisition every 15 minute would better choice using simple spectrophotometer teach science use spectrophotometer rather simple put blank press button wait 10 put sample result displayed screen addition could open student could see inside could really understand tool work avoiding black box effect also since inexpensive ten classroom would possible would allow student one instrument per pair using spectrophotometer reason also consider instrument pedagogical tool allowed u use teach basic scientific concept group child teenager school mondomo colombia make electronic design compatible arduino platform use atmega32u4 microcontroller directly connected peripheral need spectrophotometer prefer design full pcb rather make shield existing arduino board indeed extra work add microcontroller rather limited make sense point view create shield also resulting board smaller reliable component use one mainstream found ebay aliexpress special component light frequency converter tsl235r buy mouser website detail construction process follow one link underneath pcb using eagle case using freecad openscad software using arduino experiment bacteria growth pigment concentration measure fluorescence kinetic reaction test underneath find test run
